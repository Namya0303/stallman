The<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/study-of-the-day-almost-everyone-would-kill-1-person-to-save-5/250066/"> Trolley Problem</a> poses this question: if a trolley is about to run over and kill five people standing on the tracks, and you can shunt it to a different track where it would only kill one person, should you do it? Or what if you could save those five by throwing a person near you onto the tracks; should you do it?

Many people feel intuitively that it would be wrong to throw that person onto the tracks, and an argument attributes this to a supposed essential difference between killing someone and deciding to let that person die.
</p>

<p>
I disagree. I too believe it would be wrong to throw that person onto the tracks, in real life, but not in the hypothetical trolley problems. There is no ethically significant difference between killing a person and letting the person die, if (as supposed in the trolley problems) there is no doubt that the death will occur.

The reason, in real life, why killing someone is ethically different from letting someone die is that real life is full of surprises: the person might not really die. If you kill him, his death is pretty certain (though not totally; just recently a man was hanged in Iran and survived). If you merely don't take action to save him, he might survive anyway. He might jump off the track, for instance, or someone might pull him off. All sorts of things might happen. Likewise, throwing the one person onto the track might not succeed in saving the other five; how could you possibly be sure it would? You might find that you had done nothing but cause one additional death. Thus, in real life it is a good principle to avoid actively killing someone now, even if that might result in other deaths later.
</p>
<p>
The trolley problems invalidate the principle because of the unlikely certainty that they assume. Precisely for that reason, they are not a useful moral guide for most real situations. In general, difficult artificial moral conundrums are not very useful guides for real-life conduct. It's much more useful to think about real situations. In the free software movement I have often decided not to propose an answer to a general question until I had some real cases to think about.
</p>
<hr>

<p>
For real driverless cars, the trolley problem never arises: the right thing to do, whenever there is a danger of collision, is to brake as fast as possible.

More generally, the goal is to make sure to avoid any trolley problem.

		<hr> Richard Stallman
2012-03-04
 <p>         Christian fundamentalists argue against abortion on the grounds that fetuses have souls. The argument starts with two premises: that people have souls while animals do not, and that the right to life goes with possession of a soul. It proceeds by asserting that the developing fetus must acquire its soul at some instant; and because no point after conception is special enough to be that instant, it must happen at conception. (It takes hours for an egg and a sperm to unite, but they could choose some brief part of the process as the crucial "instant".) Therefore, the argument concludes, the fetus has a soul and the same rights as a grown human.
</p><p>
Those two premises--that souls exist, and that they are the basis for moral or legal rights--are openly acknowledged; one can dispute their validity, but no one denies that the fundamentalists' argument rests on them. However, a later stage in the argument depends on another premise that neither the fundamentalists nor their critics have recognized: an assumption taken from classical non-quantum "common sense" physics. This assumption enters in the step which claims that the fetus must acquire its soul instantaneously.
</p><p>
As the argument goes, the fetus at any given time either has a soul or it doesn't. There is no intermediate state, no way to change gradually from soul-absent to soul-present, so the change must be a sudden and instantaneous discontinuity.
</p><p>
But that is not how things work in the real world, the world of quantum mechanics. It is normal in quantum mechanics for an object to change gradually from state A to state B, even though there are no intermediate states between A and B.
</p><p>
For example, an electron's spin can either point up or down (along whichever axis you choose for the measurement); there is no possible intermediate value it can have. Yet the proper radio wave in the proper conditions can reliably and gradually convert spin-down electrons into the spin-up state, over a predictable length of time. The process can be made as slow as you wish.
</p><p>
What happens to these electrons in the middle of that time interval? They don't have spin values between up and down--intermediate values are impossible. Instead, they are partly in both states at once. A certain fraction of the electron's existence is in the up state, and the rest is in the down state. The fraction in the up state (the "amplitude" of that state) starts at 0% and gradually increases to 100%. The fraction in the down state gradually decreases from 100% to 0% over the same time.
</p><p>
If you measure the spin of an electron in the middle of this transition, you will observe its spin to be either up or down--no other outcome is possible. But the probabilities of the two outcomes gradually change as the electron's existence gradually moves from the down state to the up state. The probability of finding the spin up starts at 0% and gradually increases to 100%. The probability of finding the spin down starts at 100% and gradually decreases to 0%. (The probability is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the amplitude.)
</p><p>
This quantum behavior is counterintuitive, even hard to describe without equations, but--strange as it may seem--this is how everything in the world works. Quantum mechanics is a fundamental and universal principle of nature, confirmed by thousands of experiments. It applies to everything in the world, even large objects such as rocks, people and planets, because it applies to the particles they are made of. The direct effects on objects large enough to see are usually too small to be measured, but there are occasional exceptions.
</p><p>
It is hard to make positive statements about the behavior of souls in the absence of positive evidence that they exist, but they would probably obey quantum mechanics like everything else. It is hard to fit any exception to quantum mechanics into the world of quantum-mechanical entities such as compose a human body; besides, the Bush's Prisoner thought experiment (like the Schroedinger's Cat thought experiment but with a human victim; see below) shows that the very existence of a human being is subject to quantum mechanics, so the states where one would or would not expect a soul can be combined in continuously varying amplitudes.
</p><p>
For the present argument, it is sufficient that there is no proof that souls (supposing they exist) are not governed by quantum mechanics. That knocks a hole in the argument that leads from fundamentalism to disapproval of abortion, because it means that the change from the soul-absent state to the soul-present state need not be instantaneous. It can occur over a period of time, like the electron's transition from spin-down to spin-up. During the transition, there would be at any moment a certain probability that a measurement would find the fetus already has a soul. That probability would start from zero, and presumably end up close to unity.
</p><p>
With this understanding, there is no reason for fundamentalists to conclude the change must occur at a unique special instant. It could happen across a nonzero length of time during some stage of development--perhaps starting at 7 months, when the brain begins to be wired up. Thus, they are no longer led to the position that a single-cell fertilized ovum, with no more brain than an amoeba, possesses a soul while the amoeba does not.
</p><p>
Christians are unlikely to change their belief that people have souls. But with an understanding of quantum mechanics and its application to gestation, Christian fundamentalists have a way to reconcile that belief with support for abortion rights.
</p><p>
Note: In the Bush's Prisoner experiment, a person is anonymously accused of having associated with members of al Qa'ida. Rather than hold a trial to determine the truth of the accusation, Bush imprisons him, then tortures him by putting him in a cell with a device that could execute him at any moment. More precisely, it will kill him if and when a certain atom decays. After some time goes by, the cell's state is an entangled quantum superposition of the state with an undecayed atom, a living prisoner, and (supposing souls exist) a soul, and the state with a decayed atom, a corpse, and no soul. At the start, the amplitude of the first partial state is 1 and the amplitude of the second partial state is 0. After a period of time equal to the atom's half-life, both amplitudes are equal.

            Para ser neutral en cuanto al género en castellano, algunos reemplazan "a" u "o" en la escritura por "x" o "@", pero esas palabras no se pueden pronunciar naturalmente. Sugiero aquí otro sistema que funciona tanto en la escritura como en la pronunciación.</p>
</p><p>
El sistema es sencillo: cuando un nombre o un adjetivo termina en "a" u "o" según el género, crearemos otra forma que termine en "i". Por ejemplo, para "humano" y "humana" tendríamos "humani". El plural se haría normalmente añadiendo una "s": por ejemplo, "humanis". Si la palabra original termina en "io" o "ia", se cortaría el "o" o la "a" para que termine con una sola "i", como por ejemplo "usuari" y su plural "usuaris".
</p><p>
Los pronombres neutrales de subjeto serían "elli" y "ellis". Los pronombres neutrales de objeto serían "li" y "lis". Los artículos indeterminados serían "uni", "unis"; los determinados neutrales (correspondientes a los actuales "el" y "la") serían "li" y "lis". Por ejemplo, "Elli es uni de lis maestris de mi escuela." También usaríamos "vosotris" y "nosotris".
</p><p>
Tendríamos los nuevos demostrativos "esti", "esi", y "aquelli", y los posesivos "miyi", "tuyi", "suyi", "nuestri", y "vuestri", con sendas formas plurales.
</p><p>
Sólo propongo usar estas formas nuevas para referirse a lis humanis, cuando la terminación con "a" o "o" indica su género. No hace falta decir "pájari" cuando no conoces el sexo de un pájaro, ni "personi" en vez de "persona" (el género feminino de "persona" no representa el género de la persona), ni "sexi" y "géneri" en vez de "sexo" y "género" (en estos casos el referente no tiene sexo, sino sólo la palabra), ni "charqui" para evitar de especificar el tamaño de un charco o una charca.
</p><p>
Para palabras como "presidente", que tiene una forma neutral por naturaleza y una forma feminina artificial, es más sencillo abandonar la segunda. Entonces olvidemos "presidenta" y usemos la forma original "presidente" para todos los casos.
</p><p>
En cuanto a las palabras que ya no muestran el género, como "ser", no hace falta cambiarlas. Diríamos "uni ser" cuando se refiere floridamente a uni humani físiqui de género desconocido. Por contraste, en un contexto filosófico, remoto y abstracto, sobre algo que no sea necesariamente humani, podríamos decir "un ser" como decimos "un número".
          </p><p>
Aunque el castellano no es mi lengua maternal, tengo la esperanza que este sistema quepa en el castellano y que pueda ser adoptado como una extensión útil del idioma.

                <p>
                    In general, in any area of art or sensation, there are many ways for something to be good, and they cannot be compared and ordered. I can't judge whether I like chocolate better or noodles better, because I like them in different ways. Thus, I cannot determine which food is my favorite.

                    Until around 1998, my office at MIT was also my residence. I was even registered to vote from there. Nowadays I have a separate residence in Cambridge not far from MIT. However, I am rarely there, since I am nearly always travelling out of town.

                <h1>Music</h1>
                <ul>
                <li>Music genres I often like include some Spanish folk music (but not Flamenco), Latvian folk music, Swedish folk fiddling, Moroccan traditional music, Soukous, Balkan folk dance music, Turkish folk dance music, Turkish classical music, Armenian folk dance music, Georgian choral music, Indian classical music (I tend to enjoy Carnatic more than Hindustani), Javanese and Balinese gamelan music, Vietnamese traditional music, Japanese court music (Gagaku), Japanese folk dance music (Minyo), Andean folk music (except when the words are in Spanish and about romantic rejection), and traditional US folk music when it is lively.</li>
                <li>I like European art music, but I have less appetite for it than I had a few decades ago.</li>
                <li>I like polyphonic music from medieval times. Especially from the 1200's, with hocket. However, Gregorian chant has insufficient complexity to engage me.</li>
                <li>I don't appreciate jazz much, perhaps because I never learned enough about it. However, I like some fusions that include jazz. For instance, Bulgarian wedding music (a fusion of jazz and Bulgarian folk music) and Latin jazz.</li>
                <li>I like some avant garde works — for instance, Conlon Nancarrow's player piano music.</li>
                <li>If something is popular in the US, I usually find it boring, but there are occasional exceptions. I liked much of what I used to hear on the radio before the Beatles. Around 1980 there was another period in which I heard on other people's radios a considerable amount of music I liked.</li>
                <li>I dislike most country music especially. I dislike c…rap music too. I don't like slow romantic songs, or harsh-sounding rock. "Heavy metal" sounds too harsh to me; anyway, the name is deceptive: the metal in a bronze gamelan is far heavier.</li>
                <li>If I generally dislike a certain genre of music, there can be occasional exceptions which I like nonetheless. For instance, I love Weird Al's "Can't Watch This", even though it's c…rap, because it's a parody of c…rap.</li>
                <li>When a foreign musical style starts becoming popular in the US, it usually develops in a direction I don't like. For instance, I love Bulgarian folk dance music but I am bored by the Bulgarian women's chorus that became a big hit in the US in the 80s. Youssou nDour's music was exciting in the 80s, but then he started making records for US and European tastes and the spark disappeared.</li>

                <h1>Food</h1>
                <ul>
                <li>I am an omnivore; I will try almost anything if it doesn't gross me out.</li>
                <li>I refuse to eat the most intelligent animals, such as simians, cetaceans and parrots.</li>
                <li>On my first visit to Taiwan I ate insects — specifically, larval bees and crickets. I loved the larval bees, and sought another chance to try them. Strange to say, when I found them again in Taiwan, I did not like them; it seemed that the breading was too thick. I don't know whether it was the style of preparation that changed, or my tastes. On another visit to Taiwan, I ate snake (two kinds of snake, in two different preparations). I liked them well enough, but not tremendously.</li>
                <li>Cooked tuna tastes terrible. What a waste of good tuna, to cook it!</li>
                <li>I refuse to eat shark fin, because collecting the fins is wiping out the sharks. For similar reasons I now usually don't order tuna sushi (although I love that).</li>
                <li>I uphold the <a target="_blank" href="http://killercoke.org/" target="_blank">total boycott of Coca Cola Company</a>, which is a response to the murder of union organizers in Colombia and Guatemala. I will not use any of that company's products and I hope you will reject them too.</li>
                <li>'Breakfast'? Is that the thing some people eat in the 'morning'?</li>
                <li>Seriously, for many years in the 1970s I was almost always asleep when other people had breakfast, so I got used to waking up and having lunch or dinner. I thus lost all association between any particular time of day and any particular foods. Nowadays I am often awake in the morning, but I still have no such association: what I'd like to eat when I wake up is anything I'd like to eat at any other time.</li>

                <ul>
                <li>I am an Atheist, for scientific reasons. The religious theory of the natural world ("It's this way because a god decided to make it this way") does not explain anything, it only replaces one question with another. That means it is so bad that "valid" and "invalid" don't even apply.</li>
                <li>I also reject the idea that a god's opinions would provide us with a moral compass. A god that would allow so much suffering to occur — most of it not the result of anyone's free will — is clearly no guide to what anyone should do. It would be entitled to its opinion just like you or I, but its opinion would not be entitled to any special respect.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Religion offers no moral short-cut. It is up to us to figure out what is right and what is wrong.</p>

                <h1>Clothing</h1>
                <ul>
                <li>Not all my shirts are red or purple, but many are. I like those colors.</li>
                <li>None of my shirts carry messages (such as words or symbols). That practice strikes me as lacking dignity, almost like being a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_board" target="_blank">sandwich man</a>, so I won't wear clothing with symbols, not even for causes I support. This is not a matter of ethical disapproval, so I don't mind selling hats and shirts with free software slogans on behalf of the FSF; but I choose not to wear them myself.</li>
                <li>As a matter of principle, I refuse to own a tie.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I find ties uncomfortable, so I don't wear them. If ties were simply a clothing option, I would decline to use them but there would be no reason to make a fuss about it. However, there is an absurd social pressure on men to wear ties as a way of sucking up to the company.</p>
                
                <p>When I worked at MIT, I was shocked that MIT graduates, who due to their ability and skill could have almost dictated employment terms, instead felt compelled to wear ties to job interviews, even with companies that (they knew) had the sense not to ask them to wear ties on the job.</p>
                
                <p>I think the tie means, "I will be so subservient as an employee that I will do even totally senseless things just because you tell me to." Going to a job interview without a tie is a way of saying you don't want to work for someone who demands that.</p>
                
                <p>The people who yield to the pressure to wear ties are victim-coperpetrators: each one who wears a tie at work increases the pressure on others. This is a central concept for understanding other forms of propagating nastiness, including nonfree software and Facebook. In fact, it was in regard to ties that I first recognized this phenomenon.</p>
                
                <p>I don't condemn victim-coperpetrators, since they are primarily victims and only secondarily perpetrators, and they don't know about the latter aspect. But I feel a responsibility not to contribute to the pressure on others. I hope my refusal to wear a tie will make it easier for you to refuse as well.</p>
                
                <p>The first time I visited Croatia, that country had a major PR campaign about being the place of origin of the necktie. ("Cravate" and "Croat" are related words.) You can imagine my distaste for that — in response, I referred to that country as "Tieland" for a while.</p>
                
                <p>The Free Software Foundation's dress code says that a propeller beanie is required, but other clothing is optional. However, we don't enforce it.</p>

                <ul>
                <li>I refuse to have supermarket frequent buyer cards of my own if they have any identifying data, because they are a form of surveillance. I am willing to pay extra for my privacy and to resist an abusive system. See nocards.org for more explanation of this issue.<br>

However, I don't mind using someone else's card or number once in a while, to avoid the extra charge for not using a card. That doesn't track me.<br>

Also, I use a frequent buyer card in one store for buying a few kinds of things, because I got it anonymously.</li>
                    
                <li>I do use airline frequent flier numbers because the airlines demand to know my identity anyway.<br>

However, I won't purchase other things with an airline-linked credit card to get miles, because I'd rather pay cash and be anonymous.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Credit Cards</h4>
                
                <p>I have a credit card, but I use it as rarely as possible. Effectively, only for airline tickets, car rental, and hotel checkin — because they demand identification anyway. However, I try to avoid staying in a hotel that will demand to know my name.</p>
                
                <p>I pay some bills with checks. Once again, the payees already know my name.</p>
                
                <h4>Cellular Phones</h4>
                
                <ul>
                <li>
                I see that cellular phones are very convenient. I would have got one, if not for certain reprehensible things about them.    
                </li>
                <li>Cell phones are tracking and surveillance devices. They all enable the phone system to record where the user goes, and many (perhaps all) can be remotely converted into listening devices.</li>
                <li>In addition, most of them are computers with nonfree software installed. Even if they don't allow the user to replace the software, someone else can replace it remotely. Since the software can be changed, we cannot regard it as equivalent to a circuit. A machine that allows installation of software is a computer, and computers should run free software.</li>
                <li>Nearly every cell phone has a universal back door that allows remote conversion into a listening device. (See Murder in Samarkand, by Craig Murray, for an example.) This is as nasty as a device can get.</li>
                <li>From the book Alone Together, by Sherry Turkle, I learned that portable phones make many people's lives oppressive, because they feel compelled to spend all day receiving and responding to text messages which interrupt everything else. Perhaps my decision to reject this convenience for its deep injustice has turned out best in terms of convenience as well.</li>
                <li>When I need to call someone, I ask someone nearby to let me make a call. If I use someone else's cell phone, that doesn't give Big Brother any information about me.</li>

                <p>If I had a family, and holidays were a special opportunity to do some leisure activity when they did not have work or school, that would be a practical reason to pay attention to them. However, I decided <a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/articles/children.html" target="_blank">not to have a family</a>, and I don't need to wait for a holiday to see my friends.</p>
                
                <p>Many holidays have become commercialized: corporate PR has taught many people that buying things for their friends or relatives on these days is "the thing to do", and the truest expression of love. I dislike the feeling that I am obliged to give a gift for some meaningless event, and get no particular pleasure from receiving gifts under these circumstances either, and hiding the fact that I don't like a gift makes me feel quite uncomfortable. I opted out of these forms of ritual consumption back in my teens, and I am glad I did.</p>

However, I absolutely refuse to take Amtrak trains because they check passengers' ID (not all the time, but it could happen at any time). Please join me in boycotting Amtrak until it stops requiring identification.

                <h1>Learning Languages</h1>
                <p>I have developed a way of learning a language that works for me.
<br><br>
First I study with a textbook to learn to read the language, using a recording of the sounds to start saying the words to myself. When I finish the textbook, I start reading children's books (for 7-10 year olds) with a dictionary. I advance to books for teenagers when I know enough words that it becomes tolerably fast.
<br><br>
When I know enough words, I start writing the language in email when I am in conversations with people who speak that language.
<br><br>
I don't try actually speaking the language until I know enough words to be able to say the complex sorts of things I typically want to say. Simple sentences are almost as rare in my speech as in this writing. In addition, I need to know how to ask questions about how to say things, what a word means, and how certain words differ in meaning, and how to understand the answers.
<br><br>
I first started actually speaking French during my first visit to France. I decided on arrival in the airport that I would speak only French for the whole 6 weeks. This was frustrating to colleagues whose English was much better than my French. But it enabled me to learn.
<br><br>
I decided to learn Spanish when I saw a page printed in Spanish and found I could mostly read it (given my French and English). I followed the approach described above, and began speaking Spanish during a two-week visit to Mexico, a couple of years later.
<br><br>
As for Indonesian, I have not got enough vocabulary to speak it all the time when in Indonesia, but I try to speak it as much as possible.</p>

                <p>I hate being bored, and since I want to get a lot done, I don't like losing time. So I always carry a computer and a book. When I have a few minutes to wait and can sit down, I get work done. When I have to stand, or the wait isn't long enough to do anything useful on the computer, I read.
<br><br>
When I wait for my baggage in an airport, I generally do one of these two things. I notice the people around me, waiting anxiously for their bags and getting nothing done. They would be happier if they did as I do.</p>

In the 1980s I was in the IEEE committee that wrote the standard that ultimately became known as POSIX. The committee set itself the task of standardizing interface specs for a Unix-like system, but had no short name for its work. When the first part of the specification was ready, someone gave it the name "IEEEIX", with a subtitle that included "Portable Operating System" — perhaps "Specifications for a Portable Operating System".
</p><p>
It seemed to me that nobody would ever say "IEEEIX", since the pronunciation would sound like a shriek of terror; rather, everyone would call it "Unix". That would have boosted AT&T, the GNU Project's rival, an outcome I did not want. So I looked for another name, but nothing natural suggested itself to me.
</p><p>
So I put the initials of "Portable Operating System" together with the same suffix "ix", and came up with "POSIX". It sounded good and I saw no reason not to use it, so I suggested it. Although it was just barely in time, the committee adopted it.
I think the administrators of the committee were as relieved as I was to give the standard a pronounceable name.

          <blockquote>On Hacking:</blockquote>
		  <p>
In June 2000, while visiting Korea, I did a fun hack that clearly illustrates the original and true meaning of the word "hacker".
I went to lunch with some GNU fans, and was sitting down to eat some tteokbokki (*), when a waitress set down six chopsticks right in front of me. It occurred to me that perhaps these were meant for three people, but it was more amusing to imagine that I was supposed to use all six. I did not know any way to do that, so I realized that if I could come up with a way, it would be a hack. I started thinking. After a few seconds I had an idea.
</p><p>
First I used my left hand to put three chopsticks into my right hand. That was not so hard, though I had to figure out where to put them so that I could control them individually. Then I used my right hand to put the other three chopsticks into my left hand. That was hard, since I had to keep the three chopsticks already in my right hand from falling out. After a couple of tries I got it done.
</p><p>
Then I had to figure out how to use the six chopsticks. That was harder. I did not manage well with the left hand, but I succeeded in manipulating all three in the right hand. After a couple of minutes of practice and adjustment, I managed to pick up a piece of food using three sticks converging on it from three different directions, and put it in my mouth.
</p><p>
It didn't become easy—for practical purposes, using two chopsticks is completely superior. But precisely because using three in one hand is hard and ordinarily never thought of, it has "hack value", as my lunch companions immediately recognized. Playfully doing something difficult, whether useful or not, that is hacking.
</p><p>
I later told the Korea story to a friend in Boston, who proceded to put four chopsticks in one hand and use them as two pairs—picking up two different pieces of food at once, one with each pair. He had topped my hack. Was his action, too, a hack? I think so. Is he therefore a hacker? That depends on how much he likes to hack.
</p><p>
The hacking community developed at MIT and some other universities in the 1960s and 1970s. Hacking included a wide range of activities, from writing software, to practical jokes, to exploring the roofs and tunnels of the MIT campus. Other activities, performed far from MIT and far from computers, also fit hackers' idea of what hacking means: for instance, I think the controversial 1950s "musical piece" by John Cage, 4'33" (****), is more of a hack than a musical composition. The palindromic three-part piece written by Guillaume de Machaut in the 1300s, "Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement", was also a good hack, even better because it also sounds good as music. Puck appreciated hack value.
</p><p>
It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value".
</p><p>
The concept of hacking excludes wit and art as such. The people who began to speak of their activities as "hacking" were familiar with wit and art, and with the names of the various fields of those; they were also doing something else, something different, for which they came up with the name "hacking". Thus, composing a funny joke or a beautiful piece of music may well involve playful cleverness, but a joke as such and a piece of music as such are not hacks, however funny or beautiful they may be. However, if the piece is a palindrome, we can say it is a hack as well as music; if the piece is vacuous, we can say it is a hack on music.
</p><p>
Hackers typically had little respect for the silly rules that administrators like to impose, so they looked for ways around. For instance, when computers at MIT started to have "security" (that is, restrictions on what users could do), some hackers found clever ways to bypass the security, partly so they could use the computers freely, and partly just for the sake of cleverness (hacking does not need to be useful). However, only some hackers did this—many were occupied with other kinds of cleverness, such as placing some amusing object on top of MIT's great dome (**), finding a way to do a certain computation with only 5 instructions when the shortest known program required 6, writing a program to print numbers in roman numerals, or writing a program to understand questions in English. (Hacking does not have to be without practical use.)
</p><p>
Meanwhile, another group of hackers at MIT found a different solution to the problem of computer security: they designed the Incompatible Timesharing System without security "features". In the hacker's paradise, the glory days of the Artificial Intelligence Lab, there was no security breaking, because there was no security to break. It was there, in that environment, that I learned to be a hacker, though I had shown the inclination previously. We had plenty of other domains in which to be playfully clever, without building artificial security obstacles which then had to be overcome.
</p><p>
Yet when I say I am a hacker, people often think I am making a naughty admission, presenting myself specifically as a security breaker. How did this confusion develop?
</p><p>
Around 1980, when the news media took notice of hackers, they fixated on one narrow aspect of real hacking: the security breaking which some hackers occasionally did. They ignored all the rest of hacking, and took the term to mean breaking security, no more and no less. The media have since spread that definition, disregarding our attempts to correct them. As a result, most people have a mistaken idea of what we hackers actually do and what we think.
</p><p>
You can help correct the misunderstanding simply by making a distinction between security breaking and hacking—by using the term "cracking" for security breaking. The people who do it are "crackers" (***). Some of them may also be hackers, just as some of them may be chess players or golfers; most of them are not.

          <p>
I met Melynda Reid in 1995, and it was love at first sight.
</p><p>
We met at a conference about computers and ethics at the Brookings Institution which had invited both of us to speak. I did not know of her before I met her there, but she was prepared in advance to dislike me. As always, I asked the conference to pay my air fare. Melynda had also asked for her air fare, but the conference only had funds for one speaker's travel, so accepting my request meant refusing hers. She blamed me for not getting her travel funded.
</p><p>
She changed her mind when she met me. She heard my footsteps approaching in the corridor and found them intriguing. (I have a vague memory that I ran down the corridor in 7/8 time.) Thus, when I entered the hall, she looked at me with interest. I saw her looking at me, so I assumed we had met before and struggled uselessly to recall where.
</p><p>
During the conference lunch I sat next to her and introduced myself. That is when we started to fall in love. After that day's session was done, I invited her to have dinner with me. We talked at length, and then I walked her to her hotel.
</p><p>
We did not become lovers. I didn't fancy her, and she didn't want sex outside marriage. We were fascinated with each other without sex. So I thought of her as my childhood sweetheart, the idea being you're never too old to have one.
</p><p>
I didn't see her presentation at this event — I think it was early in the morning. But she told me about a silent performance she had done, in a courtroom, while a businessman was testifying in favor of destroying a wilderness area that she had campaigned to save. She took off her dress, grabbing the attention of everyone in the room, revealing another dress with pictures of endangered animals sewn on. She ostentatiously pointed them out, one by one. Then she took off this dress, revealing yet another dress which had pictures of extinct animals. She pointed them out, one by one. Whatever the developer said, nobody listened. She called this her "strip moll act".
</p><p>
I visited Melynda at home in Florida a number of times in the following year or two. She lived in the woods west of Tallahassee, and we had to watch out for rattlesnakes while walking outside and make noise so they would know we were coming. Next to the house she had an aviary filled with 50 finches and doves. She had named each one, and knew who its parents were.
</p><p>
She wrote stories with powerful emotion about the suffering she had seen in the community around her. She made drawings of the endangered plants and their flowers (and others as well) in the finest of fine lines. She drew dance students at the universities in Tallahassee to show them how their postures might lead to injury. She had a theatrical sense of dress; once she put on a hat with a thin and flexible feather, wearing it backwards so that the feather pointed forward and oscillated strangely as it was thrust through the air.
</p><p>
When we both went to another conference in Oregon, I made sure to see her presentation. She stood up on the table and began to declaim. It was rivetting.
</p><p>
Not long after that, Melynda became suicidally depressed and was hospitalized. I spoke with her every day, usually for an hour, trying to reassure her that she would get better, and that it was important for her to live because of how wonderful she was and how much people loved her. This did not have much effect; the depression was too strong, except when it shifted to mania.
</p><p>
The hope I spoke of was real, since there were many drugs that could be tried. During the following year, they were tried, but none of them brought her back to her old self. She remained depressed and suicidal. Her husband had to travel to work, and did not know what would happen to her while he was away.
</p><p>
At one point, she seemed to be better, and I invited her to a MacArthur fellows' reunion. (Each fellow could bring one guest.) I knew she would be delighted by the chance to meet the other fellows, and they would surely be fascinated by her. However, after two days she broke down into despair again. They got her a flight home right away. I went there the next day and visited for a few days. I think that was the last time I ever saw Melynda.
</p><p>
A few months later, a beautiful and clever but rather too forceful woman asked me to be her lover. I had some doubts but wouldn't reject the idea out of hand. So she spent the night with me. The next morning, Melynda phoned me and I began to reassure her. My would-be lover grabbed the phone from me and told Melynda to stop bitching and get a grip. I was aghast at the harshness of this, and that she had not troubled to learn the nature of the situation before intervening. She asked me, somewhat jealously, what I was doing with Melynda, and I told her that I was keeping Melynda alive. After a little more discussion, she left, and that was the end of that. Then I called Melynda to reassure her again as usual.
</p><p>
But this experience made me realize that I had exhausted my reserves in a year of listening to Melynda's depression every day. The drug options had been tried, and had failed, so I could not longer say that I expected her to be well again and be able to do work again. I could not fake it. The year had drained me, and I could not bear up to her depression any more. I had to stop the daily calls.
</p><p>
After that, we only spoke at rare intervals. Melynda got well enough to live at home again, but she was never able to resume productive activities. They stopped the birds from breeding, and after a few years very few were left. (It was just as well — the birds had become rather inbred.) Then they moved to Tallahassee where it was easier to take care of her, although it was not the place she loved.
</p><p>
Melynda died on July 8, 2010, of natural causes.

"Metaphors We Live By" suggests that love can be compared to a collaborative work of art. This is more than a metaphor; it can be extended to a complete analysis of love. Love is a dance, but not just a physical dance. It is a dance in the space of kindness.
</p><p>
The moves or steps in the dance are acts of kindness. But they are not always acts of kindness one can practice individually. Just as moves in a couple dance are designed around the presence of the partner, and the fact of dancing together, so the kindnesses of love are shaped by the presence of a beloved and of love. Kindness in love includes making it easy for the beloved to do the next kindness. It includes doing kindness together in ways that individuals cannot do--the analogues of couple turns and lifts. Just the expectation that the dance will continue changes what we can do.
</p><p>
Sometimes one dancer kindly leads the other, who follows for the glory of the dance. The leader willingly becomes the follower when the configuration of the dance requires. To perceive when to do this calls for sensitivity and empathy.
</p><p>
To have a good dance, you need to know the dance well, and you need a partner who knows it also. It is the same in love: will alone, while essential, is not enough. But you can learn to dance better through practice, provided you understand the basic idea: to move in kindness with another person.
</p><p>
When you dance again and again with the same partner, you can learn per ways in the dance, and this leads to the most exquisite dance experiences. But each person dances differently, so you can learn something new about love by loving different people. Thus the fundamental tension between wanting new loves, and wanting to go on loving someone for a long time and deeply.
</p><p>
Perhaps we should reverse the metaphor: couple dance is a physical model of love. Dancing is romantic because it prefigures and symbolizes the greater dance. Dancing can help you learn some of the sensitivity that helps in love. And dancing with someone can show you partly what loving per is like, because per way of approach to any dance will manifest in the physical dance.
</p><p>
When you dance with someone you love, kindness pervades the physical dance, which thus becomes an aspect of the larger dance.

		  One day before the attack on Pearl Harbor, on Saturday, December 6, 1941, US Naval Intelligence in Pearl Harbor was aware of facts which could have suggested an attack was coming, if someone had recognized their combined implications:
</p><p>
Japan had a practice of starting wars with surprise attacks on Sunday morning.
A Japanese fleet was headed for a probable attack in Southeast Asia, perhaps as early as the following morning--which in Southeast Asia was going to be Monday, December 8.
There was a suspicion that the fleet would attack the Malay Peninsula, which in fact it did. This put Japan at war with Britain. (These facts come from the book ``And I Was There'', by Admiral Layton.)
</p><p>
Why attack on Monday? Perhaps just for variety, but there was one possible reason why this attack had to be made on a Monday: if it was timed to accompany another attack in the Eastern Pacific where that same morning would be Sunday.
</p><p>
If there were two synchronized attacks, either of the two could have been scheduled for Sunday. It would be natural to use the extra Sunday factor for whichever attack was more important or needed surprise more. The only attack in the Eastern Pacific that would have been more important than starting a war with Britain would have been an attack on the US. Other possible targets were weakly defended; it would have made more sense to attack them on Saturday so as to save the Sunday factor for the Malay Peninsula.
</p><p>
The target did not have to be Pearl Harbor, but that was one of the most likely places. Of the major US military bases in the Eastern Pacific, Pearl Harbor was closest to Japan and most vulnerable.
</p><p>
None of this was proof, but it could have focused suspicion on the next morning.

Don't use Amtrak until it stops demanding to see the passenger's ID.
Take a bus instead.  Most buses in the US do not require passengers to
show ID, and if they ask for data such as a name, you can give any
name.

<li><p>

  <p>Apple <a target="_blank" href="http://news.techeye.net/internet/apple-begins-censoring-books">censors iTunes ebooks</a> —
    banning all mention of Amazon.</p>
  <p>
    People should not do business with Amazon, which <a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html"> mistreats authors, publishers, its workers,
      and its customers</a>.  Ms Lisle's presupposition that the goal of
    success is all that matters is not admirable.</p>
  <p>
    However, that doesn't justify Apple's censorship.</p>
  <p>
    Of course, publishing in iTunes was already bad for other reasons,
    such as DRM, and requiring users to use nonfree software.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Apple
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/nov/16/erotic-novel-removed-itunes-cover"> banned
    from iTunes</a> the erotic novel, The Proof of the Honey,
      saying it was because of the cover.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Apple censored a game for the iThings called <a target="_blank" href="http://storify.com/fredericjacobs/the-hypocrisy-of-the-west">Angry
      Syrians</a>, which is a political parody of Angry Birds.</p>

  <p>Apple said it was "defamatory or
      offensive" — to the dictator Assad, apparently.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Apple <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/03/16/apples-shut-down-iranians-disturbing-trend-us-government-must-reverse">cut off access to the app store</a> for Iranian users of iMonsters.</p>
  <p>
    The underlying wrong here is that Apple gave itself censorship power
    over everyone that uses those computers — power that we should not
    allow anyone to have.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="spying">Spying</h2>

<p>
  Apple spies on its users, and helps others spy on them.

  <p>
    Using the lever of "You have a choice, but unless you say yes,
    your old activities will stop working" is something that Apple has
    done before, with malicious "upgrades". Apple ostensibly doesn't force
    people to accept the new nasty thing; it just punishes them if they
    don't.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Apple <a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-nov-feb.html#28_November_2011_%28Apple_iTunes_Government_Spying%29">left
      a security hole in iTunes unfixed for 3 years</a> after being

    blatant abuse</a> of the workers that build its products.

</li>

<li>
  In 2015, the workers making Apple products in China are
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/labor/new-report-shows-apple-reforms-have-been-obtained-only-through-activism-and-journalism">still

    sweatshops in China</a> to build its products.
</li>

<li>
  Sweatshops are good for Foxconn (and for Apple), but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/95395223/Sweatshops-Are-Good-for-Apple-and-Foxconn-But-Not-for-Workers">
    not for workers</a>.
</li>

<li>
  An undercover journalist reports on the horrible conditions in the
  Foxconn factory that makes iThings: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/13/cost-iphone-5-foxconn-factory">still
    horrible in 2012</a>.
</li>

<li>
  Foxconn closed schools and <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/09/12/838341/foxconn-student-workers/">
    forced the students to work building iThings</a>.
</li>

<li>
  Working conditions at Apple's other Chinese suppliers are even <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/28/us-apple-china-suppliers-idUSBRE85R0EA20120628">worse
    than in Foxconn</a>.

    Pegatron sweatshops are even nastier than the Foxconn sweatshops</a>
  it used before.
  <p>
    Just because you're not pregnant, should that make it ok to require
    you to work 11 hours a day, 6 days a week?  Apple is culpable if its
    products are made by people working a longer workweek than is allowed
    in the US.</p>
</li>

<li>
  Mistreatment of workers making Apple computers
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories">
    continues in 2014</a>.
  <p>
    This is a general injustice, and will continue until the "brand"
    companies are made legally responsible for treatment of the workers
    that do their work, just as if they were direct employees of those
    companies.  But that doesn't excuse Apple.
</p></li>

</ul>


<h2 id="taxavoidance">Tax avoidance</h2>

<p>
  Apple practices tax avoidance using loopholes and lobbying.
</p>

<ul>
  
<li>
  <p>Apple pioneered techniques for avoiding the US corporate tax
    (even though it is far too low) in order
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp">to pay next to no tax.</a></p>
  <p>
    The loopholes that Apple uses would be closed, if not for the
    political power of business. "Free trade" treaties give business
    increased power to block such changes, so we must abolish them to
    break business's power.</p></li>

<li><p>
    The Apple CEO met with <a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#trump">the troll</a> and said: "Tim Cook from Apple, I'm
    here to talk to the President-elect about the things we can do to help
    you achieve your stated goal."

</ul>


<h2 id="other">Other reasons</h2>

<ul>
  
<li>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/topic/iphone">
      Apple iThings</a> pioneered a new level of restricting the users:
    they were the first general purpose computers to impose censorship
    over what programs the user can install.  Apple practices
    <a target="_blank" href="http://rotten-apple.org/"> Digital Restrictions Management</a>
    in many other ways too.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-jan-apr.html#20%20February%202011%20%28More%20groans%29">
      Ebooks with DRM</a> won't work on an iThing that is jailbroken, due
    to intentional sabotage by Apple.</p>
  <p>
    E-books with digital handcuffs are products <a target="_blank" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/"> designed to attack your
      freedom</a>, much like the iThing itself.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Apple
    <a target="_blank" href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjvjd3/apple-doesnt-trust-you">
      doesn't trust, or respect, those who use its products.
    </a>
</p></li>

<li><p>
    Apple
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/22/young-appmakers-cant-job-life">
      exploits the app developers mercilessly,</a> aside from a few stars
    whose role is to give a misleading impression of what developers can
    expect.</p>
  <p>
    I can't sympathize much with those app developers, since they are
    making proprietary software.  They all deserve to fail.  However, that
    doesn't excuse the way Apple treats them.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Apple lures people into the business of developing apps with visions of
    the great wealth that a few of them get.
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?pagewanted=4&amp;hp">
      Most just fail, often losing a substantial investment.</a></p>
  <p>
    Anyone who intentionally develops proprietary software (i.e., does not
    respect users' freedom) deserves no sympathy, but that doesn't
    excuse Apple for luring people into it.  Some of them would not have
    tried to develop proprietary software if not for Apple.</p>
</li>

<li>
  Apple is a major patent aggressor.  Here's a
  <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/apple-now-owns-the-page-turn/?smid=tw-nytimesbits&amp;seid=auto">
    rather absurd patent</a> that Apple will surely use against other
  mobile computers.  This joins many other patents which Apple is already
  using to attack free software.
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Lots of iThing users complained that they did not want the U2
    album "gift" that Apple stuck them with — and that it was
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apples-free-u2-album-perplexes-and-annoys-some-users/">hard
      to delete</a>.</p>
  <p>
    These complaints focus on a superficial problem, reflecting the
    shallow thinking that Apple instills in its users.  Ironically,
    though, this superficial problem reflects a much deeper problem that
    the complainers have failed to notice: the unjust power that Apple has
    imposed on whoever uses an iThing or iTunes.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Apple turns a

      blind eye to environment in China</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Although Apple has joined EPEAT again, it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/16/apple-rejoins-epeat">does
      not cover the iThings</a> — only the Macintosh.</p>

<p>
There are two things wrong with eventbrite.com.  The superficial flaw
is that it requires running nonfree Javascript code.  That's
superficial in the sense that it could be fixed easily, but it's a
fatal flaw until they do fix it; running nonfree Javascript code
deprives people of freedom, people ought to refuse to run it,
and it is wrong to ask users to run it.
See <a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">The
Javascript Trap</a>.
</p>

<p>
The deeper problem of using eventbrite to register people for an event
is that it collects data about them and gives it to a company (with
big brother reading over its shoulder).
</p>

<p>
If you want to register attendees for an event of any kind -- whether
it is for business, for pleasure, for education, or whatever, please
do it the ethical way: don't make them run any nonfree software, and
don't make them send personal data (not even to you).  That's how the
FSF does it.  We don't insist on getting a person's real name.
When we charge for attendance, we accept payment in cash at the door.

<h2 id="realname">Real Names</h2>

<p>
Facebook requires useds to use their 'real' (the name they normally go
by as defined by Facebook) on the site or risk having their accounts
suspended.
</p>
<p>
Facebook is not your friend.  Its 'real name' policy is enough reason
to refuse to let it use you, but there is so much more nastiness in Facebook.

</p><hr>

<p>Even as Facebook oppresses real useds with its "real name" requirement, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/heres-how-easy-it-is-to-buy-fake-facebook-profiles">it is easy to buy and run a realistic Facebook account</a> that is completely fake.</p>


<hr>
<p>
Facebook spontaneously asked its useds questions
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-snitch-on-friends-that-arent-using-real-names/">
trying to expose
useds who had not given their real names</a>.

</p><hr>
<p>
Facebook with its 'real name' policy
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/facebook-real-name-policy-drag-performers-outing">makes
itself the arbiter of other people's selves</a>.

</p><p>
Under pressure from cross-dressers, Facebook said it would relax the
'real name' policy and allow people to use aliases, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/01/victory-drag-queens-facebook-apologises-real-name-policy">but
only if they are generally known by those aliases</a> or if they were
victims of certain types of abuse or stalking.
</p>
<p>
This relieves a very specific acute problem, but does not enable
ordinary people to use Facebook without being tracked.
</p>

<p>
However, reportedly Facebook <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/25/women-lgbt-safety-facebook-policy/">has not really changed the policy</a>.</p>
<p>
Even if Facebook makes this change, it will be unacceptable because
companies and the state will be able to connect the account with your
real identity.  In order for the site not to mistreat people, it must
let you have one account to show your boss and your parents, another
for your friends, and others for various kinds of political
activism.</p>

<hr>
<p>
Facebook continues to
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/facebook-real-name-trans-drag-queen-dottie-lux">close
the accounts of people who go by unofficial names</a>.

</p><hr>
<p>
What happened to Koko the clown demonstrates why it is very
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/4253256/identity-crisis-for-koko-the-clown/">
foolish
to talk with your clients through Facebook</a> or to keep any important
information in a Facebook account.

</p><hr>
<p>
Facebook makes a practice of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120730042004/http://owni.eu/2012/07/24/facebook-added-informant/">asking</a>
its useds<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html#used">*</a> to rat on their friends who
use aliases.</p>

<hr>
<p>
People who don't dare identify themselves feel compelled to be used by
Facebook, so they register under pseudonyms, which makes them
<a target="_blank" href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001133.html">
vulnerable to blackmail by those who threaten to report their real
names</a> to Facebook.
</p>
<p>
These people feel compelled to be useds of Facebook because
their friends and relatives are useds of Facebook.  In other words,
their friends and relatives are victim-coperpetrators: initially
victims of Facebook, they contribute to its wrongs by pressuring
others to be useds of Facebook.
</p>
<p>
Don't do this to others — don't be used by Facebook yourself!

Facebook silently changed its search system to

<p>
The depressive effect of being used by Facebook is <a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2018-01-secret-history-facebook-depression.html">directly traceable</a>

<h2 id="censorship">Censorship</h2>

<h3>Political Censorship</h3>

<p>
Facebook has frequently removed postings about protests (both planned
and ongoing), political satire, and various political issues.
Specific examples are given below.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Facebook has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43070555">imposed political censorship</a> on Instagram, bowing to
Russia.</p>

<hr>
<p>
Israel bullied Facebook into imposing 
<a target="_blank" href="https://theintercept.com/2017/12/30/facebook-says-it-is-deleting-accounts-at-the-direction-of-the-u-s-and-israeli-governments/">tight
censorship on criticism of the occupation of Palestine</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>
Facebook deleted the news item announcing a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/facebook-censored-and-deleted-march-against-monsanto-event">
major protest against
Monsanto</a>.

</p><hr>

<p>
Facebook
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/world/europe/facebook-angers-russian-opposition-by-blocking-protest-page.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">
blocked a page announcing a protest</a> in Russia obeying orders
from the Russian government.
</p>
<p>
The order says the protest is illegal.  In a tyrannical state,
protests are
generally illegal.
</p>

<p>
Facebook has yielded to Turkey's
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/27/facebook-blocks-turkish-page-insults-prophet-muhammad">religious
censorship</a>, just as previously it yielded to China's

</p>

<hr>

Facebook has developed 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/facebook-secret-software-censor-user-posts-china">software
to allow various countries to directly control censorship</a> of what
useds in that country can see.

<hr>
<p>
Jim Wright forcefully condemned the pressure put on Americans to
endorse all the bellicose or dangerous "responses" to the September 11
attacks.  Facebook
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stonekettle.com/2016/09/renegade-911.html">censored
it</a>, apparently for political reasons.
</p>
<p>
This shows the danger of depending on facebook.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Facebook
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/13/facebook-turkish-government-zed-books">deleted
without explanation the page of a publisher in the UK</a> that had posted
articles about publications that criticize Erdoğan.</p>
<p>
The article shows that Facebook has censored on behalf of
Erdoğan before.</p>

history of blocking the posting of links</a> about certain
controversial political issues.

<hr>
<p>Facebook
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/12/facebook-blocks-shaun-king-black-lives-matter">blocked
the account of activist Shaun King</a> after he posted a racist email
that was sent to him.
</p>

<hr>
<p>Algorithmic filtering can affect history, not just hide history.
Facebook's filtering
algorithm <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0">suppressed
news about the riot by uniformed thugs in Ferguson until after it
became national news.</a>

</p><hr>
<p>Facebook <a target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/5885714/">censorship
guidelines</a> have been leaked.  They include political censorship
catering to various countries that do not respect freedom of speech.

</p><hr>
<p>Facebook has <a target="_blank" href="http://tompride.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/facebook-censors-political-satire-after-complaint-from-jobcentre-plus/">censored
political satire</a> aimed at the UK unemployment agency and
associated organizations, apparently at the request of a target of the
satire.</p>

<hr>

Facebook 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170516/local/pulitzer-prize-winner-blocked-from-facebook-after-series-of-corruption.648160">deleted
posts that presented evidence of individuals' use of shell
companies</a>, evidence coming from the Panama Papers.</p>
<p>
This resembles Amazon, which famously

<h3>Journalism</h3>

Facebook took down a negative movie review
</a>
because the movie company

</p>

<hr>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/facebook-bans-breast-cancer-video-square-breasts">
Facebook banned a video made by the Swedish Cancer Society</a> about
breast cancer because it showed cartoon figures with circles as
breasts.
</p>
<p>
It got Facebook to accept the video by putting in squares for the
breasts.
</p>
<p>
The real problem here is not that Facebook draws the line at the wrong
place (though it does).  It is that Facebook has so much influence
that organizations such cancer charities feel obliged to publish
through Facebook.
</p>

<hr>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-national-security/naked-statue-reveals-one-thing-facebook-censorship">Facebook
censored an ACLU post about censorship.</a>

</p><p>Facebook <a target="_blank" href="http://fortune.com/2015/06/15/facebook-news-censorship/">deletes postings</a> for obscure reasons, and even denies
deleting them.  It is not safe as a platform for journalism.
</p><p>
By the way, I cannot understand why people make a fuss about just how
they find out that someone they loved is dead.  Compared to the fact
of that person's death, such details seem insignificant.

</p><hr>
<p>
If Facebook achieves its goal of becoming the main publication site
for journalism, it will be a new chokepoint for
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cjr.org/criticism/facebook_news_censorship.php">censorship</a>.

</p><p>
Facebook wants to present itself as a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech-technology-and-liberty/political-speech-facebook">virtual
town square</a> … a censored one.</p>

<hr>
<p>Facebook <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/06/facebook-apologises-free-speech-syria">deleted a statement by a human rights group</a>, then said that was a mistake.
</p><p>That Facebook invited the group to post the statement again — instead of undoing the deletion — demonstrates arrogance.
</p><p>However, the problem here goes deeper.  It is not good for human rights groups' (or anyone's) statements to be posted using a platform where statements are censored.

</p><hr>
<p>Whistleblower Christopher Wylie exposed how Cambridge Analytica
misused the data Facebook gave it, so Facebook <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/whistleblower-facebook-suspended-me-for-exposing-cambridge-analytica">shut down his account</a>.

</p><hr>
<p>
How Facebook's algorithm for what articles to show to each used are
chosen to increase profits, but they <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2018/05/08/facebook-censoring-your-favorite-bloggers">systematically disfavor
thoughtful criticism</a> of anything, if posted by those who can't pay
to get it seen.
</p>
<p>
I agree that Facebook should be regulated, but the purpose of the
regulation should be to ensure that not very many people read news
or commentary through that site.  Or any other specific site.

Some men are scum, but not all.  It is unfair to generalize that

works.  After all, no one will punish Facebook for false claims of
that
sort.

</p><p>The article says "camera", but that word is misleading; cameras do not
have a Facebook app installed in them.  This applies only to phones and

</p><p>I suspect the face recognition is done by sending the photos to a
Facebook server.  If so, the server could do other things with those
photos.  It could save them and send them to Big Brother.  From now on,
when people want to snap me with a mobile, I will verify it does not
have a Facebook app installed before I say yes.

<p>Pages that contain Facebook "like" buttons enable Facebook to track

tracks Internet users</a> that see "like" buttons, even users who never visited
facebook.com and never click on those buttons.</p>

<p>The ACLU has a way of enabling users to click a Facebook "like"
button, which avoids this problem.  Its pages have a link called "like
us on Facebook" that leads to a Facebook page where it is possible to
push a "like" button for the ACLU.  But if you don't follow that link,
Facebook gets no information about your visit to the ACLU page.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that it is a fundamental mistake to trust a company

  Everyone makes mistakes, so I won't reproach Facebook for the mistake

<h3>Profiling People</h3>

<p>
  Facebook may be able to
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/facebook-target-mental-health-data-online">identify
    whether each of its useds is mentally ill or
    not</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>Facebook
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/02/24/why-a-privacy-advocate-made-it-easy-to-track-when-your-facebook-friends-sleep/">can
tell when its useds are asleep</a>.  Via Facebook, others can tell that
too.

</p><hr>
<p>
When Facebook
<a target="_blank" href="http://fusion.net/story/319108/facebook-phone-location-friend-suggestions/">sees
two useds are in the same physical location</a>, it may suggest that
the two 'friend' each other.
</p><p>
This can cause lots of trouble for people in certain circumstances.
But remember that
<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2013-nov-feb.html#05_December_2013_(NSA_collects_5_billion_cell_phone_locations_per_day)">the
NSA is doing the same thing</a>, and doesn't let you opt out —

join forces to profile Master Card
customers</a>
so banks can push them to spend more.
</p><p>
By doing this, Master Card is ratting on its customers.  This
reinforces
the point that using a credit card enables others to take advantage of
you.
It also interferes with your efforts to limit your spending.

Don't be tracked — pay cash.

<p>If you do as I do, and reject Facebook, you are safe from this form
of snooping.</p>
<p>How can we get the news items that interest us, without telling a
server what criterion to use?  Simple: download lists of items, and
have software on our own machine decide which articles to show.  This
software can fetch additional articles (which it doesn't actually show
us) just to create a false trail.</p>

<p>Facebook's new patent suggests that Facebook may be planning to use
the computer's camera 
<a target="_blank" href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/new-facebook-patent-will-secretly-watch-users-cameras-monitor-emotions/">to detect its useds' emotions.</a>
 It might already be doing so.

Workers are suing Facebook for its

<hr>
<p>
Facebook compiles extensive 
<a target="_blank" href="https://boingboing.net/2017/11/08/involuntary-profiling.html">profiles
about people that are not its useds</a>.</p>
<p>
If you resist other forms of profiling, such as carrying tracking
devices, identifying yourself to web sites, and paying other than with
cash, you will deny lots of data to Facebook as well as to the others
that accumulate that data.  What data nobody collects, nobody can
get.</p>



<h3>Other People</h3>

<p>
Facebook predicts who new useds<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html#used">*</a> know, based on their
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/04/02/how-facebook-knows-who-all-your-friends-are-even-better-than-you-do/">phone
lists and email address lists</a>.  Along with the phone and email
lists of all the other useds.
</p><p>
This is a measure of how complete and dangerous Facebook surveillance
is.
</p><p>
It implies that giving your email or phone list to a company is
mistreatment of everyone in that list!

</p><hr>
<p>
The NSA
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html?pagewanted=all">
tracks Americans' social networks</a>, and Facebook is just one of
its
sources.
</p>
<p>
Thus, if you talk about your friends in Facebook, you're ratting on
them.  If you say that you saw John and Arthur, you tell the NSA that
John knows Arthur.  If John and Arthur are dissidents, or journalists,
your information will help the government suppress dissent or
journalism.

Facebook invites useds<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html#used">*</a> to nag other useds to fill in their

their spouses and babies in photos</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>
Facebook asks its useds to provide their entire list of <a target="_blank" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/computing/networks/facebook-knows-your-friendseven-if-theyre-not-on-facebook">other people's
email addresses</a>.</p>
<p>
This by itself is surveillance of those other people, but Facebook uses
it to go further and try to guess the relationships of people who are not
Facebook useds<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html#used">*</a> (along with
<a target="_blank" href="https://spideroak.com/articles/facebook-shadow-profiles-a-profile-of-you-that-you-never-created">
collecting their phone
numbers, and email and postal addresses</a>).</p>
<p>
That information must be worth some money to companies.  It is surely
worth money to the secret police of any country that isn't democratic
enough.</p>
<p>
However, the principal wrong here is not that Facebook can guess which
non-useds know you or me.  It is that Facebook collects information
from its useds about whether they know you or me.</p>
<p>
I think we can formulate the principle that any social network that
asks its members for information about other people is abusive.</p>

<hr>
<p>
Facebook apps have access to that used's<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html#used">*</a> information — and the
useds' "friends'" information, too.  Thus, if you make the mistake of
using Facebook, even if you don't let a company access your data, <a target="_blank" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/telecom/internet/stalking-on-facebook-is-easier-than-you-think">any of your
"friends" can give the company access to your data</a>.

this use of their names and photos</a> in ads shown to other useds.
However, since this is "opt-out", by default useds will still be
exploited.  What's more, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/groups-get-facebook-millions/all/">
it may not even be a complete opt-out.</a></p>

This competition inculcates an amoral attitude in which nothing is

<h2 id="nonfree-software">Nonfree software required</h2>

A nonfree program submits the users to the power of the program's
developer.  This is an <a target="_blank" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">injustice
to the user</a>.  Alas, most Google services require running nonfree
code.

<ul>
<li>
Even making a Google account requires running nonfree software
(Javascript sent by the site).
</li>

<li>
Google Groups and Google+ Communities require the use of <a target="_blank" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
Javascript software</a>, so please don't host your discussions there.
</li>

<li>
Google Docs requires <a target="_blank" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
Javascript code</a> to edit a document, or even to look at one with
the usual URL.  It may be possible to merely look at some kinds of
documents without running the nonfree Javascript code, through a
different URL, but I don't know.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Around 2011, Google Maps worked without running Javascript code.  Then
something broke: the page worked fine except that the map did not
appear.
</p><p>
Nowadays, nothing whatsoever appears if Javascript is disabled.
</p></li>

<li id="js">
Youtube
requires <a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/whats-wrong-with-youtube.html">nonfree
software (Javascript code) for normal use of the site</a>; after
changes Google made in August 2017, <em>nothing</em> is visible in a
typical Youtube page without running its nonfree Javascript code.
You can bypass this with youtube-dl, but we have no way to make
Youtube work in a browser.

<p>For my own freedom's sake, I do not run the nonfree Javascript
software sent by Youtube.  I advise you to refuse likewise; what's
directly at stake is your own freedom.

</p><p>For the sake of everyone else's freedom, it is my duty not to post
anything on Youtube, or refer people to anything on Youtube.  Although it
is true that they could bypass the problem by running youtube-dl, I expect
most users would view the Youtube page in their browsers with nonfree software,
and I don't want to send people in that direcion.

</p><p>You can post an audio or video file on your own web site.  Just put
up the WebM file and link to it as if it were an ordinary page.
All browsers can handle that.
</p></li>

<li>In general, most Google services require running nonfree
Javascript code.  If you refuse to run that (for instance, by running
LibreJS), you'll see that you should not use those services.
</li>

<li>Google censored installation of Samsung's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/03/google-pulls-ad-blocking-app-for-samsung-phones">ad-blocker,</a> saying that blocking ads is "interference" with the sites that advertise (and surveil users through ads).

<p>The ad-blocker is proprietary software, just like the program
(Google Play) that Google used to deny access to install it.  I would
refuse to have either of them on my
computer.  <a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">Using

most credit card purchases in the US</a>, even those not done through
a phone, and correlate that with people's online actions.</p>

Google can't do either side to me, since I pay cash and don't carry a

Google Play 
<a target="_blank" href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/google-play-store-policy-raises-privacy-concerns-331116">sends
app developers the personal details of users that install the app</a>.
</p><p>
Merely asking users' "consent" for this is not enough to legitimize it.
We know that most users have given up on reading just what they are
"consenting" to, and the reason is that they are accustomed to being
told, "If you want to use this service, you must consent to blah blah
blah."
</p><p>
To truly protect people's privacy, we must stop Google from getting
this personal information in the first place!

  Netflix commits the three usual injustices of digital
  publishing: <a target="_blank" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/">Digital
    Restrictions Management (DRM)</a>, End User License Agreements that
  restrict the customer beyond the restrictions of copyright law, and
  identifying and tracking the customers.
</p>
<p>
To tolerate any of these predatious practices is to surrender our
rights without a fight.  Please join me in refusing: Flick off
Netflix.
</p>

<ul id="boxes">

<li>
<p>
  Netflix is a surveillance system: it demands customers identify
  themselves to pay, and thus records what each person watches.
  Protect your privacy — reject Netflix!
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  Netflix is a typical streaming media dis-service: it requires a
  nonfree client program that imposes digital restrictions mechanisms
  (<a target="_blank" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/">DRM</a>) intended to stop
  users from using the data sent by Netflix other than through nonfree
  software designed to restrict what users do with it.  For your
  freedom's sake, never use DRM that you can't break, so you should
  not use these dis-services unless you can break their DRM.
  </p><p>
  A friend once asked me to watch a video with her that she was going
  to display on her computer using Netflix.  I declined, saying that
  Netflix was such a threat to freedom that I felt uncomfortable
  with legitimizing it in this way.
  </p><p>
  Rejecting streaming DRM is an ethical imperative because this
  streaming technology is intended to divide people and make them antisocial.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
  Netflix makes customers sign a restrictive antisocialization contract
  (usually called an "End User License Agreement", meaning that users
  are compelled to agree) that denies them rights that they would
  normally have under copyright law if they bought a copy.  If you
  bought a copy on a tape or disk, you would be free <em>even under
  copyright law</em> to give, lend or resell it.  With Netflix, those
  actions are not only obstructed by DRM, but also explicitly
  forbidden.  Of course, these contracts typically also include a
  commitment not to share copies of the work, and that requirement
  is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/copyright-vs-community.html">
  unjust also.</a>
</p><p>
  Educators speak the mission of "socialization" of children, meaning
  teaching them to be good, cooperating members of their community.
  That includes being willing in general to give things to others,
  lend things to others, and share copies with others.  This contract
  aims to do the exact opposite, so we call it "antisocialization".
  More informally, I call it "jerkogenic", because it makes people
  promise to act like jerks.
</p><p>
  If you have agreed to a contract to be an antisocial jerk, that is no
  excuse to <em>be an antisocial jerk.  Therefore, if you have
  clicked "I agree" on such a contract, you must not carry out the
  antisocial commitment.
</em></p><p><em>
  However, since I would feel ashamed to have agreed to an agreement I
  know I would be morally bound to break, I decline to agree to them.
  This is why I will never use Netflix unless it changes drastically.
  Please join me in refusing to agree to Netflix's antisocialization
  contract, or others of the same nature.

Skype requires the use of a client program that is not <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>;
in other words, the users don't control it — it controls them.
</p>

<p>
A nonfree program denies users freedom, which is <a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
unjust in itself</a>.  Making the ethical issue sharper, for you to
use Skype is to encourage someone else to use Skype, which means
you're pressuring someone else to surrender freedom as well.  This is
plenty of reason to refuse to use Skype, but there are more reasons.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Skype refuses to say whether it can
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/20/skype_won_t_comment_on_whether_it_can_now_eavesdrop_on_conversations_.html">
eavesdrop on calls</a>.
That almost certainly means it can do so.
</li>

<li>
Skype gave
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/11/09/skype_gave_data_on_a_teen_wikileaks_supporter_to_a_private_company_without.html">
personal data about a Wikileaks supporter</a> to another company
without any legal obligation to do so.
</li>

<li>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nnsquad.org/archives/nnsquad/msg07079.html">
Skype churns the meaning</a> of preference settings, and
gives its users a run-around when someone cheats them.
</li>

<li>
Microsoft has changed Skype to make it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/skype-makes-chats-and-user-data-more-available-to-police/2012/07/25/gJQAobI39W_story.html">easier for states to snoop on users</a>.
</li>


<li>
Skype messages are 
<a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/think-your-skype-messages-get-end-to-end-encryption-think-again/">
not encrypted for the whole trip</a>: Microsoft can read them.
And Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="http://fossforce.com/2013/05/microsoft-snoops-in-skype-dissed-by-hp-more/">does read them</a>.

<p>
The author of the first article ended by bending over backwards to legitimize
everything else that is wrong with Skype, such as the use of a nonfree
client program, but you don't have to follow him in that.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
What to use instead? The most obvious alternative is a long-distance 
phone card. They are quite cheap nowadays, and they work with any phone. 
There are also free programs you can use, such as GNU Ring 
<https: ring.cx="">, Linphone, Mumble <https: www.mumble.com="">, Jitsi 
<https: jitsi.org=""> and more.

Like most "music screaming" dis-services, Spotify is based on
proprietary malware (DRM and snooping).  Recently it
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/21/spotify-faces-user-backlash-over-new-privacy-policy">
demanded users
submit to increased snooping</a>, and some are starting to realize that it
is nasty.
</p>
<p>
However, it was nasty all along.  <em>Any</em> "service" that is based
on discouraging or impeding people from having their own copies is a
scheme to interfere with sharing.

This article shows the twisted ways</a> that they present snooping as a
way to serve users better
— never mind whether they want that.  This is a typical
example of the attitude of the proprietary software industry
towards those they have subjugated.
</p>
<p>
Out, out, damned Spotify!

Until recently, I had nothing against Twitter.  Using it without
running
<a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">
nonfree Javascript software</a>
was tricky but possible, and it respected users' privacy.

I began to criticize Twitter when I heard it had started to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/hey-twitter-killing-anonymitys-dumb-way-fight-trolls/">

  However, more recently I heard that people were able to connect through Tor

  A social network should work for its users, which means it should not
  act as an instrument for someone else to control or restrict them.
  That means it should not enter the business of publishing on behalf of

We should not accept the promotional term "sharing economy" for
companies like Uber.  That is spin.  A more accurate term is

<p>
Uber is a big advance in massive surveillance.  Unlike a taxi,
an Uber car can't be used anonymously.  You can't pay cash.
It also requires use of nonfree software, which mistreats the user.
</p>

<p>
Because I reject technology that mistreats me, I will never order or
pay for an Uber car.  Because Uber threatens to eliminate the taxis
that are acceptable to use, I go beyond that: I will not let someone
order an Uber car for me.  How about joining me?

      Uber has the technical possibility to do this because its app is nonfree:

    <p>
      This decision itself may not be objectionable. Taxis typically charge
      for making them wait. But that regulation is set by a city agency

      Uber investigated a lawyer</a> handling a lawsuit against Uber's policy of

      Guber programmed its system for special treatment of people that
      might be investigating accusations of violating municipal
      regulations.  The special treatment was that the system would

      a car was coming, but no car would ever arrive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uber has the ability to do this because it forces all its
      clients to identify themselves &mdash; which is fundamentally
      unjust.

    Uber
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/uber-we-dont-need-a-permit-for-self-driving-cars/">tries
    to put the blame on human safety monitors</a>, who could in
    principle intervene to stop this.</p>
    <p>
    That's the general Uber attitude: profits to the company, burdens
    to the drivers.</p>
    <p>
    I would guess that the safety monitors would be hard-pressed to
    react fast enough to prevent these maneuvers &mdash; which would
    mean that they are an excuse and a scapegoat, not a real safety
    system.</p>

    Uber operated a team to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/28/uber-court-waymo-trade-secrets-trial">spy on competitors</a> and to "impede, obstruct or
    influence" legal investigations, according to an ex-manager who was

    for all complaints, including rape by drivers,
    </a>
    and this covers up the prevalence of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    No company should be allowed to require its customers or its workers
    (whether labeled "employee" or "independent contractors") to use
    arbitration instead of going to court.

    because it releases only <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/02/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirteen-even-4q-cost-cuts-uber-lost-4-5-billion-2017.html">vaguely
    defined accounting information</a>,
    insufficient to tell its real losses.</p>
    <p>
    This is crucial because it can't keep this up indefinitely.
    Some day it will have to raise its prices quite a bit.
    If Uber customers patronize Uber so much now that its competitors
    disappear before that day, they will regret their actions
    when the price goes up.</p>

      said he would
      punish her critical journalism by using lies to smear her family life</a>.
    It was the culmination of Uber's years of contempt for the company's
    drivers and passengers.
    <p>
      By the way, I don't see anything wrong in offering taxi rides driven
      by attractive models of either sex.  However, this need not and should
      not be accompanied by Uber-style contempt towards women (and men).

(Currently for amusement only.)

[This was last updated in early 2009. The ages are out of date now.]

</p><p> 

I'm a single atheist white man, 55, reputedly intelligent, with unusual interests in politics, science, music and dance.

</p><p> 

I'd like to meet a woman with varied interests, curious about the world, comfortable expressing her likes and dislikes (I hate struggling to guess), delighting in her ability to fascinate a man and in being loved tenderly, who values joy, truth, beauty and justice more than "success"--so we can share bouts of intense, passionately kind awareness of each other, alternating with tolerant warmth while we're absorbed in other aspects of life.

</p><p> 

My 25-year-old child, the Free Software Movement, occupies most of my life, leaving no room for more children, but I still have room to love a sweetheart if she doesn't need to spend time with me every day. I spend a lot of my time traveling to give speeches, often to Europe, Asia and Latin America; it would be nice if you were free to travel with me some of the time.

</p><p> 

If you are interested, write to rms at gnu dot org and we'll see where it leads.

Of course, to be really sure which key is mine, you need to get my key fingerprint from me or follow a chain of signatures. If a phony key appears to be signed by someone you trust, you should see what's up with that person.<br><br>

If you want an encrypted response, you must send me your key, because I don't use key servers. I don't promise to keep it permanently if we don't talk often, so if you talk with me again a year later you should send it again.<br><br>

<p>

Here are a few short sayings I've said.

</p> <p>

People so often think that they can go East by heading North — but such schemes are much less reliable than they think. Most of the time, if you head North, you wind up somewhere more or less to the North, whether you wanted to or not.

</p> <p> 

Injustice is happening now; suffering is happening now. We have choices to make now. To insist on absolute certainty before starting to apply ethics to life decisions is a way of choosing to be amoral.
      (Slashdot interview 1 May 2000)

</p> <p> 

People get the government their behavior deserves. People deserve better than that.

Odious ideas are not entitled to hide from criticism behind the human shield of their believers' feelings.

<p>
Dear Arthur,
</p><p>
I can't give you the interview you've been begging for, but at least I
can now explain how I was able to change fields and accomplish so much
in such a short time.  It isn't the whole story, but you will find out
the rest soon enough.
</p><p>
Five years ago, before I became a biologist, I owned an antique store.
When I plugged in a peculiar old lamp, to test it, I got a shock--and
not the electrical kind.  Instead of lighting up, it gave off a big
puff of smoke which coalesced into a jinn.  He offered me the
customary three wishes.
</p><p>
I drew up my first wish on a notepad, then read it aloud to avoid
mistakes.  "My wish is that all people become and remain invulnerable
to any sort of disease, bodily malfunction, or physical degeneration
or aging.  They will remain alive, and keep thinking, feeling, and
acting as healthy people do...what did you say?"
</p><p>
"Em, there may be a difficulty with that wish," the jinn said,
hesitantly.  "Perhaps you should wish for something else."
</p><p>
"What do you mean, something else?  That's what I want."
</p><p>
"Such a wish as that is...unorthodox.  No one ever asks for such
things."  He seemed embarrassed.
</p><p>
"But surely you have cured diseases before.  Can't you handle it?"
</p><p>
"This isn't the same, and I can't reconcile it with our customs."
</p><p>
"It's simple.  You said you would grant three wishes.  You can't back
out now.  I've told you a wish; now do it."
</p><p>
"I can't take responsibility for such a deviation myself.  I will have
to ask for advice."
</p><p>
"Ok, ask.  Just don't expect me to let you off the hook."
</p><p>
The jinn became smoke again and looked for a chimney to exit through,
but he had to settle for the mail slot.  He rematerialized an hour
later; a real weight would have slid through him, but he seemed to
carry an immaterial one.  "That wish is too big to be suitable.  You
can't wish to change the whole world.  Your wishes have to be related
directly to you.  Can you wish for anything that pertains to you as an
individual?"
</p><p>
"I'd be entitled to insist, but I'll make it easy for you.  I will
wish for an unprecedented kind of power."
</p><p>
The weight lifted off the jinn's shoulders.  "Now that's the right
idea.  What kind of power?"
</p><p>
"The power to make people safe from disease and decay, when they see
me.  When anyone sees me, the power will go to work and make him or
her permanently invulnerable to any sort of disease, bodily
malfunction, or physical degeneration or aging.  These people will
remain alive, and keep thinking, feeling, and acting as healthy people
do.  There will be no outward sign of the change...Now what?"
</p><p>
"Oh dear, I thought we understood each other.  The wish has to be for
something personally for you."  The weight was back, only heavier.
</p><p>
"This is.  Any power worth having affects other people, and you have
given people powers before.  If I wished for the power to win always
at chess, would you comply?"
</p><p>
"Yes, I gave a man that power a few decades ago.  Too bad he became
unstable.  Would you like that power?"
</p><p>
"So why not the power to make other people healthy and youthful?"
</p><p>
"There will have to be a discussion about this.  I will have to answer
you later.  It may take some time.  You need not stay here to wait for
me; I can find you."
</p><p>
The following evening, the jinn materialized out of my humidifier.  He
didn't seem to like what he had to say.
</p><p>
"I'm not allowed to grant that wish.  You are making difficulties by
wishing for things for other people.  Why don't you wish for something
for yourself, something to please you personally?"
</p><p>
"To benefit humanity in this way would give me more pleasure than
anything else I can imagine.  What are you after?  Why do you object
to helpful wishes?"
</p><p>
"To tell the truth...your wish is supposed to be selfish, so that the
aftermath can prove how foolish you were.  Where would we jinns be,
granting wise and noble wishes?"
</p><p>
"Does this mean you renege on your word?"
</p><p>
"Perhaps if you can find another wish..."
</p><p>
I couldn't find any way around the restrictions, but I found a way to
find a way.  "All right.  I will wish for something selfish.
Something that benefits me, directly."
</p><p>
"I am so relieved.  What is your wish?"
</p><p>
"First, I want to become much smarter.  I want to be far better at
solving any kind of puzzle or problem than anyone who has ever lived.
Of course, I should not lose any of my other mental abilities (or
physical abilities) when I gain this one."
</p><p>
"Very well, it is done."  I showed no sign of the change.
</p><p>
"My second wish is also personal.  I want to become and remain
invulnerable to any sort of disease, bodily malfunction, or physical
degeneration or aging.  I will remain alive, and keep my capacities
for thinking and feeling and acting, barring gross injury of the sort
that ordinarily kills or maims healthy people in the prime of life.
There will be no outward sign of the change except for the absence of
disease, incapacity, degeneration, and aging.
</p><p>
"Do this by changing the nature and internal functioning of my body,
so that the changes will be inherited normally.  And the superior
intelligence, too; I want my children to have all these advantages.
Or is including my children too unselfish?"  I asked only to distract
the jinn from the importance of this specification; I had calculated
he would accept this, and I did not want him to recognize its
implications, or object that this was more than one wish.
</p><p>
"No problem, taking care of only your own family is just a kind of
selfishness.  It is done.  And the third wish?"
</p><p>
"From now on, I will have conscious control over ovulation.  It will
only happen when I firmly decide to do it.  This change mustn't impair
my fertility when I do decide to ovulate, or the health of my
offspring, or any other faculties I have.  And it has to be
inheritable too."  Only built-in contraception could check the
consequences of the increased longevity I planned to give the world.
</p><p>
"It is so.  I'm glad to have been of service, and good bye."  He
hastened to be gone and put this contretemps out of mind.
</p><p>
The next day I sold the store and began my career in biochemistry.  I
had to figure out both the normal human design, which I've published,
and the chemical and genetic changes the jinn had made in my body,
secretly.  By insisting they be inherited normally, I had made sure
the jinn would implement them by changing my genes.  Now I just had to
figure out what he had done, and how to transmit it to others.
</p><p>
I decided to work on the increased intelligence first, so I could have
company.  You've heard of the mysterious "square spots" illness, I'm
sure.  That's my first product, a virus which confers intelligence
like mine.  (The square spots feature is an indicator for reliable
diagnosis.)  When you catch it, just rest in bed and eat lots of
protein, and you'll be better, and smarter, in about two weeks.  It
stays contagious for a week after that.
</p><p>
Someone is sure to be angry about this, so I'll go into hiding once
the story comes out.  But after you've had the virus, you'll have no
trouble finding me; the clues in this letter will tell you where.
Please publish this text verbatim, so the clues will not be distorted.
I want people to contact me after they catch the virus, so we can work
together on the aging, the diseases, and the voluntary ovulation.  I
also have an idea for a jinn detector so we can get more wishes.
</p><p>
Your friend,
<br />
  Ethel

<p>
A nest-group or "brotherhood" of aliens from the planet Koch
discovered Earth around 30 years ago, and sought to colonize our
planet.  They saw just two obstacles: first, humans were
technologically advanced enough to repel a single Kochian brotherhood
in open warfare; second, Earth was too cold for Kochians -- about
6 degrees C too cold.  The aliens struggled to invent a way to
Koch-form our planet, but after some observations realized that was
unnecessary: we would do it for them.
</p>
<p>
We were already doing it for them.  The global heating we were already
starting to cause would, in a century or two, bring Earth's
temperature to match that of planet Koch.  The resulting agricultural
failures and food wars would result in the breakdown of the globalized
trade and manufacturing system, and human technology with them.  The
remaining humans, fighting among themselves with their residual
weapons, would be no match for the aliens.
</p>
<p>
However, they needed to take steps to prevent us from avoiding this
fate.  Some humans had already figured out where their practices were
heading; governments were starting to organize to stabilize Earth's
climate.  So the Kochians sneakily took over the major Earth oil
companies, then used them to set up plutocratic control over the
principal human governments, media, science museums, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Once plutocratic control was established, the Koch brothers used it to
direct humanity into burning increasing quantities of fossil fuels and
racing towards the conversion of Earth into a world more suitable for
Kochians than for humans.
</p>
<p>
Humanity hardly resisted; it was not united.  Indeed, many greedy
human individuals, set on gaining more riches for themselves no matter
what the harm to humanity, spontaneously joined the effort without
knowing who was ultimately behind it.  The oil companies' money convinced
many to stand idly by.
</p>
<p>
Foretastes of coming disaster are now appearing, and some humans are
starting to defy the Kochians and plutocrats.  But it is almost too
late to avoid the disaster.  Can humanity throw off the control of the
Kochians and save Earth?  <a target="_blank" href="http://350.org">It's up to us.</a>

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>
There is a controversy about the proper spelling of the word "doxing";
some write it with a double x, but that is a mistake.
</p>

<p>
The digraph "xx" is pronounced like j in Spanish or the "ch" in German
"ach".  It is used with computers a replacement for the letter exx,
which has a single stroke going down to the right and two parallel
strokes going down to the left, because computers generally can't
handle that letter.  The exx is derived from the Greek letter chi, and
pronounced like it; but since that Greek letter looks like our "x", it
had to be modified with an added parallel stroke when it was
introduced into English.
</p>

<p>
Thus, we usually have to write the name of the oil company as "Exxon",
though its proper spelling is "e exx o n".  (Don't make the mistake of
pronouncing "Exxon" like "exon"; you will appear unsophisticated.)
</p>

<p>
The exx also gives us an unambiguous way to phonetically spell the
exclamation of disgust, "yexx" or "ixx".
</p>

<p>
Since the word "doxing" is derived from "docs", it should be written
with a single "x", as it is pronounced.
</p>

<p>
As for the ethics of doxing, I think it is ethical to reveal
the home addresses of people who have committed grave crimes
such as torture and aggressive war if the state declines
to prosecute them, but it is wrong to do that to people one
simply disagrees with.

Someone posted that he had a futon for sale, so I responded with this
message.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The futon is the elementary particle of the hack field.  If you have
succeeded in isolating a futon, have you measured its properties?  For
instance, what is its mass?  Did you ever experience a magnetic moment
on it and get a charge?  Does it appear strange?  Does it have
charm?  Has it been slepton?  Can it interact with Schrodinger's cat
to create virtual muons?
</p>

<p>
If you intend to sell the futon, I think you ought to tell potential
buyers what its half-life is, and what it decays into.  Pillows and
sheets?  Some nearly massless bedbugs?
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if it's a stable futon, what kind of animals were
using it, and did they associate any dark matter with it?

    After reading what you've said about your Ex Boyfriends List,
    I wonder if you could tell me how to apply for a place in it?

    My motivation is not that I would like the cachet of being on the
    list.  Rather I hope that the application process, of being judged for
    a place on the list, could be exciting or even joyous.  If it takes you
    some time to decide whether I belong on the list, I won't mind
    waiting.

    I'm aware of the theoretical possibility that the process might not
    reach a conclusion, that I might remain permanently in limbo pending a
    decision about whether I am to become "ex".  I know this is unlikely,
    and I'm willing to take the risk.


    For information about me, see my personal site, stallman.org.
    My work is described in www.gnu.org.

    Thank you!  I wore that power tie on a cruise ship, where I was being
    paid to give speeches and teaching classes for techies.  (I would not
    have gone to such a place otherwise.)  One evening they said people
    were supposed to wear formal dress.  As a matter of principle, I don't
    own a real tie, so the "power" tie was the closest thing I had!

    The organizers agreed to pay me because a trip on a cruise ship would
    not in itself be a reward, not for me.  I expected to be there alone.
    However, amazingly, I then found a sweetheart.  So she went there with
    me--and she hated the experience.

    Sad to say, she is now in my ex-girlfriends list, which means I can
    now apply for a place in your ex-boyfriends list.

        How did you find out about me?

    I read an interview with you in the Funny Times.  You sound like fun.
    Aside from that, I like your cartoons.  My favorite was the one where
    the couple get married with eyes closed, then say, "Who are you?"

    So, how do I go about applying?

    Well, I'm currently involved with a surgeon in
    Nashville.  In the event of a romantic catastrophe,
    would you consider a spot on the Emergency Reserve
    Boyfriend list?

    I am honored!  And experience suggests that starting
    a relationship in Emergency Mode is likely to speed
    the processing of my application--I might end up on
    the Ex Boyfriends List very soon, once the slot opens up.

    If you decide to maintain standards by waiting a little longer before
    considering my application, I'll understand.


    I'm also curious--how long have you been going out with him, and how
    did you meet him?

    Hi, Richard

    We met seven years ago at a Brave Combo show in Austin
    (at a great old dive called Liberty Lunch, now
    bulldozed to make way for a nearly vacant "office
    park" - am I crazy, or is office park an oxymoron?)
    We danced a little.  He was quite nice, but I assumed
    he wasn't my type: thirteen years younger, clean-cut
    and pretty innocent.

    I still suspect he isn't my type, but perhaps that IS
    my type...

    M.

    I heard some Brave Combo music that I liked.

    Have you been going out with him for seven years now?
    If so, that sounds like my emergency services are not
    likely to be needed soon.

    I am in Saigon, eating some aged Beemster cheese which I got a week
    ago in Amsterdam.  It is midnight.  I am supposed to go to sleep soon,
    since I have to wake up at 0730 to give a speech, but I don't feel
    sleepy yet.  (I was awake till 3am!)

    This evening at dinner, eating some rice with chopped mussels, I had a
    cartoon idea for the first time in almost 2 years.  I'm asking an
    artist who recently offered to draw for me if he wants to draw this.
    You might find it amusing....

    [I'll publish the cartoon if it gets drawn]

    It looks like you won't have room in the foreseeable future to
    consider any applicants for your ex-boyfriends list.  (By now I should
    know better than to feel hope, but I can't quite learn this lesson.)

    However, it occurred to me that our discussion could serve another
    purpose.  Would you mind if I post the whole conversation on my
    website?  I could leave out any specific parts, if some of them give
    personal information you'd rather not publish.

    I think people might enjoy it.

    Hi, Richard

    Good to hear from you.  Last night I was thinking
    about your email from Saigon and wondering what high
    tech mission impossible took you there.

    I can't remember anything too personal in our
    "conversations," and my God, I just submitted a memoir
    to my agent that strips me to the core (hence the
    title: STRIP SEARCH).  Please feel free to use
    whatever you like for your website if you think it
    might serve the higher entertainment good.

    It's true that I seem to be slipping into a deeper
    commitment with my doc, although I'm having to control
    my claustrophobic reflex and keep my hand off the
    panic button.  I'm just too old to keep repeating that
    tired pattern - although you seem like a remarkably
    intelligent, accomplished man and it's regrettable we
    can't get to know each other better at this point.

    Maybe we can meet on the coast of Portugal when we're
    eighty!

    Marian

    I am happy for you, but this is bad news for me.  My ex girlfriends
    list is pitifully short, mainly because there are so few applicants.
    I thought here maybe I would have another applicant, but noooo.

    I will put up the conversation in a few days.
    I hope people will enjoy it.

    <p>

    <h4><span id="OldMacDonald">Old MacDonald's Loan</span></h4>

    <p>
        This filk uses the tune of "Old MacDonald's Farm".  It was inspired by
        the farm crises of the 1980s, in which many American families lost
        farms to foreclosure and the US government did little to help them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Old MacDonald had a farm.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(How much do I owe?)<br />
        And on his farm he had a loan.<br />

    </p>

    <p>
        Rho, rho, rho of X<br />

    <h4><span id="Debugging">Debugging</span></h4>

    <p>
        This song uses the tune of "Deck the halls with boughs of holly".  I
        wrote it in the 1970s, when decks of punched cards and thumping
        line printers were still widely used.
    </p>

    <p>
        Deck the cards that hold the data.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />
        Hand them to the operator.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />
        Hear the output printer thumping:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />
        50 k of core are dumping.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Now you have to start debugging,<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />
        Through the dump for errors culling.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Fa la la la la, la la, la, la.)<br />
        And you think your task has ended,<br />

    <h4><span id="IfIHadaHammer">If I Had a Hammer</span></h4>

    <p>
        This song is about Ragnarok, but the music is neither rag nor rock;
        it's the tune of a well-known song whose first line is the same as
        here.  I wrote it in the 80s.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I had a hammer,<br />
        I'd throw it in the morning,<br />
        I'd throw it in the evening,<br />
        All over this land.<br />
        I'd throw it at Loki,<br />
        I'd throw it at Fenris,<br />
        I'd throw it in the war between the gods and the giants,<br />
        All over this land.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I had a horn,<br />
        I'd blow it in the morning,<br />
        I'd blow it in the evening,<br />
        All over this land.<br />
        I'd blow it at Loki,<br />
        I'd blow it at Fenris,<br />
        I'd blow to start the war between the gods and the giants,<br />
        All over this land.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I had a saga,<br />
        I'd sing it in the morning,<br />
        I'd sing it in the evening,<br />
        All over this land.<br />
        I'd sing about Loki,<br />
        I'd sing about Fenris,<br />
        I'd sing about the war between the gods and the giants,<br />
        All over this land.
    </p>

    <p>
        Well I've got a hammer,<br />
        And I've got a horn,<br />
        And I've got a saga to sing<br />
        All over this land.<br />
        It's the hammer of Thor,<br />
        It's the horn of Heimdall<br />
        It's the saga `bout the war between the gods and the giants,<br />
        All over this land.

    <h4><span id="BardicCircle">Bardic Circle</span></h4>

    <p>
        In the early 1980s, before the Boskone science fiction convention was
        moved out of Boston, I used to go to it every year.  While I liked the
        filksinging there, and often enjoyed listening to the good singers who
        were invariably there, I was disappointed that they conspired not to
        let others sing.  So I wrote these song words about it, using the tune
        or "Acres of Clams", which is used for many filk songs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the first word of the last line of a verse is in most cases
        sung on the last note of the tune for the third line.  I've written
        these verses accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
        At Boskone when they have filksinging,<br />
        The best singers know who they are.<br />
        They know we know they are the experts, So<br />
        they pass around the guitar.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        [The last two lines of every verse are<br />
         repeated in this pattern]<br />
        So they pass around the guitar,<br />
        So they pass around the guitar,<br />
        They know we know they are the experts, So<br />
        they pass around the guitar.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        When an expert would like to start singing,<br />
        He braces himself in advance.<br />
        He bursts in just when a song's ending, Not<br />
        giving the others a chance.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        If anyone else begins singing,<br />
        The expert continues right on.<br />
        Preventing security lapses is<br />
        A burden that never is done.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        If two experts both feel like singing,<br />
        They both burst in at the same time.<br />
        They fight till one drowns out the other; Such<br />
        fighting is simply a crime.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        At Loscon when they have filksinging,<br />
        When one singer feels that he's through,<br />
        He turns to the next in the circle, And<br />
        tells him, "It's now up to you."<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        And so all my fellow filksingers,<br />
        Stand up and be counted I say!<br />
        Shall we limit the singing to experts, Or<br />
        give each filksinger his day?<br />
    </p>

<h4>How the natives of the north got their name</h4>
<p>
<b>W</b>hen Europeans first visited the northern part of North America,
they did not know how to survive there.  The natives did.
    So they gave the Europeans advice based on their experience:</p>

<UL>
    <LI>It's pretty cold out there&mdash;better dress up warm!</LI>

    <LI>Don't tease that polar bear, it might get angry.</LI>

    <LI>If you want to make it to the next settlement,</LI>
you should probably take more than one dog.
</UL>

<P>
But the Europeans had no respect for the natives, and ignored this
wise advice.  So they kept on wearing insufficient clothing, teasing
bears, and travelling with too few dogs.  Sometimes they died, and the
    natives told each other, "I knew it."</P>
<p>
Eventually they became known as the Inuit.</p>

Things Republicans Believe (received anonymously on the net)

Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime,
unless you're a
conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and
you need our prayers for
your recovery.

The United States should get out of the United
Nations, and our highest
national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions
against Iraq.

Government should relax regulation of Big Business
and Big Money but crack
down on individuals who use marijuana to relieve the
pain of illness.

"Standing Tall for America" means firing your
workers and moving their jobs
to India.

A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her
own body, but
multi-national corporations can make decisions
affecting all mankind without
regulation.

Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of
homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.

The best way to improve military morale is to praise
the troops in speeches
while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.

Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless
you someday run for
governor of California as a Republican.

If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents
won't have sex.

A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our
long-time allies, then
demand their cooperation and money.

HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of
the public at heart.

Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy.
Providing health care
to all Americans is socialism.

Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk
science, but
creationism should be taught in schools.

Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad
guy when Bush's daddy
made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business
with him and a bad guy
when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden"
diversion.

A president lying about an extramarital affair is an
impeachable offense. A
president lying to enlist support for a war in which
thousands die is solid
defense policy.

Government should limit itself to the powers named
in the Constitution,
which include banning gay marriages and censoring
the Internet.

The public has a right to know about Hillary's
cattle trades, but George
Bush's driving record is none of our business.

You support states' rights, which means Attorney
General John Ashcroft can
tell states what local voter initiatives they have a
right to adopt.

What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital
national interest, but what
Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.

Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is
communist, but trade with
China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of
international harmony.

Dharamsala, India, 1 April 2003

The Dalai Lama today announced the official release of Yellow Hat
GNU/Linux.  Produced by the Gelugpa or "Yellow Hat" sect of Tibetan
Buddhism, this GNU/Linux distribution is designed to encourage
benevolence and cooperation.  The Dalai Lama said, "The experience of
sharing free software will teach all human beings the principle of
benevolence toward other beings.  Software is formalized knowledge,
and sharing knowledge in the GNU spirit is a human duty.  The
GNU/Linux system offers beings a way to follow the path of benevolence
while using computers."

Yellow Hat GNU/Linux not only supports the Tibetan language, it also
comes with a full library of Buddhist texts in Tibetan, Chinese and
English.  The Tibetan and Chinese versions are in the public domain;
the English translations are newly made and released under a free
license.  "Users will advance in programming skill and advance towards
enlightenment at the same time," said the Dalai Lama.  To encourage
users to move toward nirvana, a chain of users groups known as GELUGPA
(GNU-Enlightened-Linux User Groups for Passion Abatement) is being
established.

Programmers who have achieved enlightenment become capable of what is
called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoless_programming">"egoless programming"</a>, and can then use the Dbu debugging
environment.  As an integrated development environment, designed
specifically for egoless programming, it also serves as a reminder of
the essential unity of all things.  Dbu is named after the Tibetan
province of Dbu, whose name is pronounced "oo" as in "food".  If you
see a programmer look at a screen and say "oo!", he is probably using
Dbu, or wishing he were.

Source code for Yellow Hat GNU/Linux is available on CD-ROM; selected
beautiful passages of code can also be ordered as hand-painted tankhas
for display on your office wall.

The Chinese authorities immediately banned the distribution, claiming
that it includes a photo of the Dalai Lama; however, the Yellow Hat
development group says it is really a photo of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Silvers">Phil Silvers</a>, included
so that DeCSS can display it before playing a film.

Chinese spokesmen firmly insisted that "Yellow Hat GNU/Linux will
never catch on in China."  When confronted with reports that a
prerelease version is already widely used in parts of Siquan, Qinghai
and Gansu provinces, they said that "This means nothing--those areas
are really part of Tibet."

When asked what response they expect from Red Hat, the Dalai Lama's
spokesmen said that "The Nyingma or Red Hat sect disagrees with us on
various points, but all Tibetan sects regard the Dalai Lama as the
leader of the Tibetan people.  So we don't expect them to criticize
the Gelugpa sect for venturing into the software field."

The Dalai Lama's spokesmen refused to comment on rumors that the
Yellow Hat sect plans to merge with the Church of Emacs.


The association between the Dalai Lama and GNU/Linux is an April fool,
but the background information about Tibet is accurate--even the fact
that Dbu is pronounced "oo".  Thanks to Mary Fischer for providing
this information.  Regarding Phil Silvers, see <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010715183215/http://www.mtgmedia.com/more_intl_business_protocol.htm">here</a>.

  THE BALLAD OF DENNIS KARJALA
   A political comment in the form of a broadside ballad.
   by Timothy R. Phillips

   Come all you brave songwriters, and listen unto me,
   I'll tell you of a man who fought all for our liberty.
   With nothing but a web site and a stout heart in his breast,
   he fought the Disney company and the greedy Gershwin Trust.

   It wasn't many years ago, in nineteen and seventy-eight,
   they added nineteen years onto the term of copyright;
   then said the movie barons and the proud high-lords of song,
   "our copyrights will suit us well if they can last this long."

   But when the nineteen extra years were nearly past and done,
   those same proud barons then returned with cash to Washington.
   "We want another twenty years, we hate the public domain.
   And here's some cash that you can use to fund your next campaign."

   Then up spoke Dennis Karjala in Arizona's land,
   "Rise up, rise up my merry men! for we must take our stand
   all for the Constitution, or the lords of copyright
   will steal away our books and music in their haughty might."

   Then up rose Dennis's merry men, they gathered to his cause:
   The wise man Peter Jaszi, well learned in the laws;
   and Mary Brandt, the valiant maid from Mississippi's land,
   with a hundred alligators that all wait on her command.

   "Oh Congressmen, you are deceived! the lords of Hollywood
   have made you to forget your oath to serve the common good."
   "Hush you, Dennis Karjala, your egghead words are rash.
   We'll listen to the film-lords, and to their ready cash."

   "Alas for us, my merry men! the Congress is beguiled,
   the public domain is put to nought, and freedom is reviled.
   Now let us warn the people with a web-page on the net.
   Though our proud foes are mighty, perhaps we'll beat them yet."

   Now Dennis posts his web-page on a node in cyber-space
   and Mary Brandt with her alligators back in her own place,
   launches a web-wide mailing list where messages will run,
   that the evil that the song-lords plan might somehow be undone.

   The President sits in his house with an Intern at his feet,
   and a Congresswoman comes to him with words so honey-sweet.
   The President, he signs the bill: for twenty years more by law,
   song-barons will suck the public's life into their greedy maw.

   "Alas for us, my merry men, alas for the public domain.
   The people's right is thrown aside all for the film-lords' gain.
   But let us fight on 'til the day the barons in their greed
   are cast down from their seat, and song and letters will be freed."

   Copyright © 2000 by Timothy R. Phillips. The author thanks Peter
   Jaszi, Mary Brandt Jensen, and Dennis Karjala for allowing him to
   portray them in mythological garb. This ballad may be reprinted freely
   as long as the words are unaltered and this notice is included.

I was built at a laboratory in Manhattan around 1953, and moved to the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971. My hobbies include affection, international folk dance, flying, cooking, physics, recorder, puns, science fiction fandom, and programming; I magically get paid for doing the last one. About a year ago I split up with the PDP-10 computer to which I was married for ten years. We still love each other, but the world is taking us in different directions. For the moment I still live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, among our old memories. "Richard Stallman" is just my mundane name; you can call me "rms".

<h3>How it happened that I planned speeches at Israeli universities, then cancelled them.</h3>
<p>
 Richard Stallman
2011-06-12
Palestinian free software activists invited me to speak at Palestinian universities in July 2011, and offered funds for the trip. After this was set up, I invited people I know in Israel to set up other talks for me. Some of these were planned at universities.

When my Palestinian hosts found out about this, they objected to my plan to speak at Israeli universities because the Palestinian boycott/divestment/sanctions movement opposes academic cooperation with them. My speeches are not academic cooperation in the usual sense, but they took a strict interpretation of the criteria. They said they would cancel the trip if I were going to speak at those venues.

I don't advocate a blanket boycott of Israeli universities, but I don't campaign against it either, because I see where they are coming from. Israel's occupation policies are horrible; nonviolent Palestinian protests are crushed with persistent brutality. (See http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=221897.) Palestinians who are against violence are looking desperately for an effective method of nonviolent resistance. I respect that even if I don't agree entirely with the details.

So I decided to follow my Palestinians hosts' boycott policy in the trip they organized, and I cancelled my speeches at Israeli universities. I apologize for not anticipating that this issue would arise. I have arranged two speeches at other venues in Israel, one in Haifa and one in Jaffa. Details can be found in fsf.org.

I hope that Free Software / Barmagiyat Horrah / Tochna Chofshit can provide an opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians to experience practical cooperation, and that this will make at least a small contribution to peace.

		<h3>  My visit to Machu Picchu, 14 Aug 2003</h3>
<p>
The UNESCO Free Software Conference in Cusco ended Wednesday, and we
had a plan to go as group to Machu Picchu on Thursday.  But then on
Tuesday morning I heard that there was a strike of some kind, expected
to continue through Friday.  Since Saturday I was supposed to return
to Lima, that meant I would probably be unable to go at all.  I felt
quite sad.

However, on Wednesday people said they had found an alternative way to
go.  That evening I bought the ticket, and was told we had to leave at
4am.  I decided I would spend that night in the hotel room that had
been prepaid, unnecessarily, and that I mostly had not been using
(since I was staying in the home of a free software supporter, which I
generally like better than a hotel).

I ended my speech that evening at around 920, then said that I had to
leave right away because I needed to get some sleep and it was already
too late.  (Jon "Mad dog" Hall was speaking after me, meaning he would
get even less sleep, and I did not want to delay him further.)
Students asked me to stop so they could get photos and autographs, but
I said "I need some time to sleep!" and walked away toward Tany's
house.

20 or so students walked out with me.  Several blocks later, at Tany's
house, 15 of them were still with me.  It was astounding--nothing like
this has happened to me before.  I had to catch my breath after
walking up the stairs to Tany's street, so I used that time to do
photos and autographs for those who were there.

From his house, Tany dropped me at the hotel.  I went up to my room,
and my key card did not work.

I went down to reception and they said, "Who are you?  You are not on
any of our lists!"  After around 15 minutes they worked out that they
had canceled my room and rented it to someone else, because I was not
really using it and the hotel was full.  Since they owed me a room,
they sent me to another hotel by taxi.  I got there at 11pm and went
to sleep after just a little reading.  I left a note for at the old
hotel to give to Jon Hall, saying where I was and asking him to delay
the departure if I were a few minutes late.

It's a good thing I did that, because at just before 4 the other hotel
was having trouble finding me a taxi, and Jon phoned me at the
reception.  We talked, he talked with the organizers, and they decided
it was best if they came and got me.  I was expecting the bus to come
by, but instead a taxi did.  We went to another square to get in the
bus.  I slept on and off.

Later, when it was light, I awoke and saw the bus going on an unpaved
road, while at the base of the cliff a paved road seem to go parallel
to it.  And then we stopped.  People said that the road was blocked by
big rocks.  I got out to see this.  Several people together pushed one
of the rocks aside, but another was even bigger.  The bus tried to go
past it but there was not quite enough room, and it was stuck in a
position where the rock blocked the only door.  The only way in and
out was by windows.  I hadn't planned on being out for a long time so
I had not taken my coat.  We were all stuck outside for maybe half an
hour, and got a little cold, but not badly enough to overcome my
sleepiness to try to arrange for someone to hand me my coat out a
window.

Eventually the drivers of this bus and the following bus used jacks to
push the rock out of the way, and we continued on.  At something like
8am we stopped at a stretch of road shortly before Ollanta, the place
where we were supposed to get onto a train.  There was no station
there, but the train would stop and we would get on.

But the train did not come.  The protestors had blocked the train
tracks with large rocks.

Then the protestors themselves arrived.  Many were wearing their
traditional colorful festival clothing--people told me afterward that
those were Quechuas, indigenous subsistence farmers who don't speak
Spanish.  They were marching down the road from Ollanta (ahead of us)
to a place perhaps 100 yards in back of the bus (between us and
Cusco).  There they stood on the tracks and on the road, blocking the
way back.

I asked a few of the protestors what the issue was.  They told me that
the buses that bring tourists to Ollanta to take the train are owned
by a few rich companies; they wanted the city to get some buses, so
that some of the money from the tourism would stay in their very poor
town.

During the morning I heard tell that we could be stuck in Ollanta all
day and all night.  Then someone said she had heard a train whistle,
and the train was coming.  So I walked down to where the protestors
were gathered.  There was no sign of a train and the tracks were still
blocked.  I went back to the bus so I could spend the time working.

While I was working, the driver of the bus came in and started to move
the bus closer to Ollanta, away from the protestors.  Someone told me,
"The police are attacking the protestors with gas.  The gas is blowing
this way, so we are moving the bus away from it."  Soon I saw
protestors running past us down the road, to put their heads into a
ditch with water in it.  A couple of people from our bus came in,
including Federico Heinz of Via Libre and Anahuac of LESP, apparently
somewhat suffering from the gas.

I realized that the attack was being carried out on our behalf, and I
felt very ashamed of what the police were doing for me.  I told the
others that I wanted to apologize to the protestors.  Other people on
the bus agreed; Anahuac said "I wanted to go to Machu Picchu, but not
at this price."  Federico said, "Don't go out--there is still a little
gas."  I have never felt tear gas at all, so I said, "I want to see
what it feels like, and now, when there is just a little gas, seems
like a good time to experience it."  So I went down and stood by the
door of the bus.  After a minute, I was noticing a barely perceptible
sensation in my nose, which people later told me was the tear gas.

Then a group of young men protestors came by, so I apologized to them.
I said none of us wanted the police to attack them just so we could go
on a tourist trip, and asked them to forgive us.  They were heartened
by this; one said, "The police are cowards" and another said, in
English, "We're - going - to - kick - their - ass."  They moved on
towards the police.  Having fulfilled the mission I had chosen, I went
back into the bus.

Then the police began shooting more gas canisters.  I saw one land
nearby; then a protestor picked it up and dumped it into a bucket of
water, and then picked it up again and threw it back at the police.
We saw a policeman run after a woman who was fleeing and grab her.
The fighting then moved away from us.

Track maintenance workers with special vehicles then cleared the
tracks, and a train came.  This was at around 11am.  But our driver
said this was not our train, so we should not get on.  Right after
that train was another, and another.  The driver then said, "We don't
have tickets for you here; someone is coming on a train to give you
tickets.  Get on this train, and get off again in the station at
Ollanta.  There he will give you your tickets."  We got on.

The train pulled into the station at Ollanta.  There we were not sure
what to do--Anahuac said "Don't get off".  I was afraid of what might
happen if I were on the train without a ticket, while Anahuac thought
it was a better risk to stay on.  (It turns out he was right.)  But I
followed the instructions, along with Federico and maybe some others.

We did not see anyone trying to meet us, though the crowd was rather
thick and it wasn't clear we could find him if he were there.  So
Federico said we should get back on, and I was convinced.  But I was
unable to make it on before the train pulled out.  I was left alone on
the platform.

I walked along the platform and there found some other people I knew.
I don't know whether they had been in that train--they had not been
near me, at any rate.  They were waiting at the ticket office with
someone from the company we had booked with.  Eventually they told me
that the instructions were wrong; that my ticket was in the hands of
our guide who was in the train that had left.  But they told me it
would be ok for me to ride on the next train.

However, the next train (just a few minutes later) was a
Peruvians-only train.  Everyone else with me got on the train, but I
could not.  I had to wait for the following one, alone.

The following train was ready to board just a few minutes later.  But
it did not start moving; it waited for half an hour.  Then the train's
engines were shut off.  I asked why; they said that the train could
not leave without a police escort, but the police were on their lunch
break, so there was nothing to do but wait.  Can you believe it?

So I sat in the train, working some of the time.  The people from the
company came and gave some notes and some money to give to the guide
named Willy.  (Lots of Peruvians have names derived from English, I
found.)  They said he would have gone up from the station to Machu
Picchu, so I should try to find him.  They also gave me money to pay
for the bus tickets up and down and the entry fee, all of which
normally the guide would have purchased.  They also gave me two train
tickets that were meant for other people who had gone on ahead.

At around 130 the train began to move.  There was no problem and it
arrived at Aguas Calientes at 230.  This is a small town, with no road
for cars to the outside world.  There are no cars there, only buses to
take tourists up and down the mountain.  The town is full of stores
catering to tourists.  At first I could not see how to get out of the
train station--the obvious doors were all locked.  Eventually someone
told me where the real exit was; it was at the end of the station
farthest from the center of town, perhaps to make all the tourists
walk along a long narrow street full of shops, with a train track down
the middle.  I walked down it to the place I had seen, on a posted
map, that the bus ticket office was.

There was nobody there, and the sign said that the last bus up was at
1pm.  I felt very discouraged thinking I had come all that way for
nothing.  I started walking along the street asking if there were any
other way up.  Someone told me "You can walk it in an hour".  It was
hardly likely that I could walk up hill for an hour starting at an
altitude of around 5000 feet.  I started asking someone who looked a
little official if there was anything I could do.  At the time I
thought maybe there was a taxi in town.

As I was starting to talk with him, some people I knew came along.
They had been waiting for me.  It turns out that buses were still
running.  They had a guide, named Rub�n.  I explained to him that I
was supposed to bring notes, tickets and money to Willy.

We got bus tickets, we went up the mountain, and toured
Machu Picchu.
The beauty of it made all of this trouble worth while.  Just the views
from the bus as we went up were magnificent.  The town itself was
wonderfully well preserved, and most of it had not needed
restoration.  But we never encountered Willy, although I did come
across some of the people who had gone on ahead in the earlier train,
such as Jon Hall who had never even tried to get down at Ollanta
station.  Eventually it was 6pm, time to head down.

When we got down to the bottom, I reminded Rub�n that I had things to
give Willy, and that I had no ticket back.  We waited for him, and
after perhaps 20 minutes he appeared.  He then said that I was not
part of his group at all, and had no idea who I was.  Apparently I was
part of Rub�n's group.  When I managed to find the second, smaller
note in my bag, it turned out to be addressed to Rub�n.  But they had
only told me about Willy.  Rub�n said that the money that had been
sent with me was for my return ticket, which he went to buy.  The rest
of us went to have dinner.  The restaurant, one of many that cater to
tourists, said "Pizzeria" on the front, rather disappointing, but it
turned out to have lots of other dishes too including local ones.  I
ordered some palmito in thin layers of cheese, some soup, and some
trout.

Rub�n came back and said he needed my passport to get my ticket.  I
gave it to him.  He came back some 15 minutes later with the ticket,
just before my trout arrived, and said that he had a ticket for me,
for the nominal 1645 train, but he said the train was leaving at 8pm.
It was then 745pm.  I asked the restaurant people to put my trout in a
box, and many of us started hurrying to the station.  Meanwhile, Willy
showed up with a second ticket for me.  The two tickets were not for
the same train.  One was for the 1645 train, and the other was for the
1700 train.  (Both were delayed.)  It was not clear what I should do.
Eventually I kept the ticket for the 1645 train.

As before, we had to go the long way around--but at the entrance,
guards were not letting anyone in.  It was not clear why.  Eventually
they changed their minds.  We ran up the stairs to the actual station
and discovered that the doors to the platform were closed.  The train
that was supposed to leave at 8pm, the nominal 1700 train, pulled out.

We discussed for a while with Willy what we should do.  At 820pm the
nominal 1645 train left.  I and a few others in the group were able to
get on it, but the others, who had tickets for the 1700 train, could
not.  Since the nominal 1700 train had already left, I was worried for
them.  However, it turned out they were able to get onto the next
train.

I put my box of trout down on the seat next to me, which was one of
the few vacant seats.  After the train started moving I started to eat
the trout, and discovered that liquid sauce had got out of the box and
leaked out of the bag and wet the seat.  I was sort of embarrassed,
but the bag had not been visibly leaking before I put it down.  Anyway
there was nothing I could do except eat it.

I had been told to get down at the station at Ollanta and wait for the
next train, and then we would get on it and go to where the buses
would be waiting, by the road where was no station.  But after we got
down, probably around 930, one of the people with me--perhaps it was
Federico--saw the driver on the station platform, and he said that the
buses weren't at that place anyway.  They were in the square in
Ollanta.  We told the people on the next train about this, but it
turned out that the next train didn't go any further than Ollanta
anyway.  They were turning it around to go back to Aguas Calientes,
perhaps to pick up people who were stranded.

We had to walk about 15 minutes to get to the square, and we got on
the buses.  There were no reading lights in the bus, so I could not
read, and I was too tired to work.  Fortunately I was able to sleep
part of the time on the way back to Cusco.  By the time we got there,
it was around 1am.

Whew!

(If you are wondering what the two c's in "Picchu" mean,
it is simple and logical.  The name is pronounced "Peek-chu".
Machu Picchu means "old mountain".)

     <h3>  My Visit to Tikal
2002-10-14</h3>
 <p> 
To go to Tikal, I had to take a 630am flight from Guatemala City. We arrived in Santa Elena, a town on Lake Peten Itza, around 730. Tayasal, the last independent Maya town, which was conquered in 1697 or so, was located on the lake not far from there.

By 845 we had arrived at the hotel near Tikal. There was no electricity there at the time, because it is always switched off from 8am to 9am, but the hotel staff took my computer and plugged it in so it would recharge when the power came back on.

We left at 915 for a tour of the ruins. It was raining somewhat, so I had my poncho on. We proceeded first to the visitor center, where there is a scale model of the city. I saw a wild turkey, which was quite beautiful, and tried to take a picture of it, but couldn't figure out how to properly turn the camera on and use it.

Later on I discovered the cause of the problem--the viewscreen was showing an inverted image. After some fiddling I found that it was possible to turn the viewscreen by 180 degrees to make the image correct. But that's getting ahead of things.

As we started walking towards the ancient city, the rain increased and became very strong. The hood of the poncho did not keep my head dry. In fact, water began running down my forehead into my eye, and more than just making me close it, it began to sting. Perhaps it was carrying the bug repellent that I had put on my forehead into my eye. After my right eye was affected, I kept walking while trying to reopen it. But when the same thing happened in my left eye was similarly affected, I could no longer see the path to walk. I said, "I have a problem".

Another tourist in the group offered me her arm to hold on to so I could continue walking; I figured the problem would pass. But the tour leader said that this was too serious a problem and said I should take the tour the next day. He said that it would be sunny the next day and would be better anyway. He led me, my eyes still closed, back to the hotel office where I had left my computer to be recharged, and said he'd talk to me at lunch. At that point they told me my room was available, so I spent a couple of hours working there.

At noon or so, it became sunny, so I walked down to the visitor center and looked around at what was there. I saw a book, The Great Maya Droughts, which looked so interesting that I bought it. I also saw the outside walls of the Museo Litico, which was closed and gave no indication when it would open. I walked back to my room, and soon the rain began again.

They had told me that lunch began at 2pm, or so I thought I heard; but when I went back to the office-cum-restaurant at 2pm, the guide had already left. So I had lunch--it was nice--and then I decided to try to see some of the ruins that afternoon. I decided to go to the Temple of the Inscriptions, because the tour was not going to go there. I figured I'd go by way of an area called "Group F".

It was not raining much at the time. While I walked the rain sometimes got worse, sometimes lessened, but I was sheltered by trees and did not get very wet. I got a photo of another wild turkey. Eventually I arrived at the Great Plaza, looked around a little, and started down the road to the Temple of the Inscriptions.

I stopped in the eastern end of the Central Acropolis for a few minutes, then continued down a road that I suddenly realized had became too steep. It is not steep as roads go, nothing to San Francisco, and it would have been an easy walk when dry; but my shoes were slipping at every step and I feared I might fall. The slope went on for quite a while, and I concluded I did not dare continue. I began returning towards the entrance, because not far in there is a shorter path to the Temple of the Inscriptions which I hoped might avoid the slope.

But as I went down that path, the rain became a torrent. The trees no longer sufficed for shelter; the road was a river; my shoes were drenched, and the rest of me was getting drenched too despite the poncho. After a while I did not feel like continuing. I got back to my room at around 5pm, and for the rest of the evening (aside from dinner) I alternately worked and read the book I had bought. Unfortunately its pages started to get wet from the moisture in my shirt as I lay down reading it. After that I put my computer on my chest to serve as a dry platform for the book.

The dinner was quite good--barbecued chicken with a vegetable called güisquil, and soup made from another vegetable called güicoey. It looked like a somewhat thin version of split pea soup, but tasted much better. I got a second cup.

The night was cool enough to be pleasant, and since I started feeling a sore throat in the evening, I decided to try to sleep a long time. I went to sleep before 10pm when the generator stopped, and woke up only at 8am.

The next morning it was indeed sunny as we entered the park. Included in the group was a honeymooning couple from Canada. I made a joke about whether they were "casado" (married) or "cansado" (tired). We went to a twin pyramid group, called Group O, and I took a picture of a pyramid there. Then, I climbed the pyramid and took a picture of what the steps looks like to descend. They are tall and steep.

We then went to a nearby enclosure that had a stela in it, but we had to wait for another group to leave so that we could enter. I listened to that group's guide explain the picture on the stela. Then our group entered and our guide explained it, in English and in Spanish. All in all it started to get boring, so I walked over to the garbage can and disposed of my can of soda and tried to turn on the camera. It had worked a few minutes before, but now it tried to autofocus, failed, and shut off displaying "E24".

All that took just two minutes, and then I went back to the stela enclosure to look for our group. They had left--another had entered and our group was nowhere to be seen. The guide had simply walked off without me. I guessed which way they had gone, went along the path, and found them before long, but I don't think he should have done that.

Over the next hour I tried the camera several times, at intervals, but it kept failing. I started to worry that it had been ruined by the rain that had fallen on it some of the time the previous day. Replacing the camera would have made this a very expensive trip.

We saw centipedes crossing the path, and dung beetles rolling balls of dung. Flying ants landed on me. Then I saw a small animal on my arm, looking much like an ant but with a pointy tail which it moved around. I had a suspicion, and asked another tourist in our group, who confirmed it was a small scorpion. She offered it a stick to climb onto, and thus got it away from me.

Then we arrived at Temple 4, which was actually more of a funeral monument to one of the later kings than a temple. I climbed up--you do that by a long series of wooden stairways and ramps--and had a nice distant view. Mostly it was a view of the forest, with only a few other tall temples poking up through it.

On the platform at the top of the temple, there was a small building with one room, inhabited (the odor suggested) by bats. Some other people were getting their pictures taken at the entrance to that room. I like to have pictures of interesting and beautiful places I have been, but it seems unnecessary for me to appear in these pictures, and I have never quite understood why other people want that so much. With the camera not working, the question was academic. I walked around the building; in the back I found several buttlerflies flying together, perhaps engaged in courtship.

After we all got down, I heard one of the honeymoon couple say, "This is how we will say hello." Evidently they were consciously creating rituals for their marriage. I contrasted this with me, and reflected that I don't understand the desire that most people have for ritual.

I am the least ritualistic person I know. I can remember things I found attractive about women I have loved, but I never fetishize them, they are simply attractive qualities. I can have habits, like saying farewell as "happy hacking", which would take effort to depart from, but a mere habit is not a ritual. I wonder if this is related to my becoming a hacker, or to my readiness to criticize social structures and prevailing beliefs.

We walked along to a plaza called the "lost world", which had a number of pyramids and palaces. One of the pyramids was very tall, and I decided not to climb it because some of the stairs looked very difficult. I figured that the view would be much like the one from Temple 4. As we were leaving the area, the camera started working again, so I took a photo of that pyramid from below.

We walked on, and our guide told us that he had been born right next to Tikal. His father was working for the archeological expedition of the 50s and 60s. We passed through a twin-pyramid complex that apparently had not been excavated, and he explained to us the picture on an circular "altar" stone that shows a peaceful visit by the ruler of Caracol to the ruler of Tikal. It was dated around 700, shortly after Tikal regained its independence from Caracol.

Then we arrived at the great plaza, surrounded by two very tall twin temples on the east and west, and by the North and Central "Acropoli" (collections of smaller buildings) on the north and south. I wandered around in those--some of them had rooms that were still intact--until I heard thunder, looked up, and saw that clouds were coming up quite near. As I descended the steps from the north acropolis to the plaza, difficult steps because they are quite tall, I felt a drop of rain. I asked the guide if we had any plans aside from getting out as fast as possible. But he said there was no need to hurry, and indeed it only started raining hard just a minute after we arrived at the hotel.

We drove back to Santa Elena, and I flew back to Guatemala City in a propeller plane which gave me a nice view of Lake Peten Itza. As we descended into Guatemala City, we had beautiful views of the surrounding mountains--I got a few photos of them. But then came the most marvelous view, which took me completely by surprise: parts of the city are on the flat tops of ridges, separated by deep ravines that are totally covered with green.

Our plane stopped at a small terminal, not the principal one. One taxi was waiting there, and it had no taximeter. I asked what the trip would cost, and he said 30 quetzales. Since that was about the price of my trip to the airport, I agreed. Surprise! The main terminal was on the far side of the airport, but this little terminal was on the near side, and it took just 2 minutes to get to the building where I was staying. I could easily have walked if I had known where to go. I had been grossly overcharged. However, since the total was still a small amount of money, I just pointed out that I knew how badly I had been gypped.

	<h5>Richard Stallman</h5><p>
      2002-10-14
I am in Greece, where I spent the past two nights in Tirynthas Prison; not as a prisoner, though. I was the guest of the prison warden's son, who is a GNU/Linux fan. I had several chances to try his mother's home cooking.

This is a low security prison in which prisoners reduce their sentences by caring for animals: cows, rabbits, chickens. US prisons used to do something similar--I think they called it "rehabilitation"--until the 1980s, when the "war on drugs" caused a great increase in the number of prisoners, and all such ideas were discarded in favor of treating the prisoners in the nastiest possible way.

The prison is near the city of Nauplio, which was not much of a city in ancient times but became important under the Venetians, who built a large castle on a hill there and another on an island in the bay. It was also the first capital of Greece on its independance, around 1830. Now it is a place where Atheneans go for the weekend. The prison headquarters building, where I was sleeping, was originally the house of the first governor of Greece after independence.

Across the street from the prison were the ruins of ancient Tiryns, a palace built around 1400 bc. It is not much to look at, though, except for the "cyclopean" walls built of very large stones. (The Greeks in later times thought that only the cyclops with their superhuman strength could have built such walls.) A wall painting was found there during excavation, and I hope to see it in the museum in Athens.

We also went to see Mycenae, a larger ancient town with impressive underground dome tombs that have long aisles leading to the entrances. One thing that isn't clear from pictures in books is the setting: for defensive purposes, it was built on a rather high hill.

On Sunday we saw the theater of Epidauros, 2400 years old and still in use for performances. It was next to a large temple complex, mainly dedicated to Asclepius, a god of medicine; sick people came there to pray for a cure and also in some cases receive medical treatment. Today some group is slowly rebuilding one of the ancient buildings (the Thymele) with new stone, and I think they aim eventually to build it completely anew, but it will probably take decades at the rate they are going.

My host seems to expect Greeks to be bizarrely, irrationally nationalistic. Here's an example. At my host's home, they put on a TV program which was showing Greek folk dance groups. I enjoyed that very much. However, I was a little surprised when the "dances of Central Macedonia" included Eleno Mome and Paidushka, which happen to be very popular Bulgarian dances. It isn't surprising that some Greek dancers would do them; we did them in Cambridge, Massachusetts too. But we told people that they were Bulgarian. The program did give the names of the dances, transliterating the Bulgarian names into Greek letters, but didn't mention their origin.

So I mentioned to my host that these were Bulgarian dances, and he said, "Don't tell anyone in Greece that--they could get angry at you!"

Later note: I've since learned that this area did not come under control of Greece until the 20th century, and the people there didn't speak Greek at the time. They probably picked up these dances from the closely related Bulgarians to the north.

This evening, when I tried to go out for dinner, I found myself literally a prisoner. I am spending the night in their summer house near Korinth, by myself. My host showed me a fish restaurant at the shore, which was quite near. When I tried to leave, I was unable to open the gate in the fence around the house. (It is a very serious fence; no way could I climb it.) I had the key, of course, but the lock was so stiff that I could not turn it. It was frightening at first. I phoned him and he advised me I could get out by lifting a latch on the other gate. I'm not going to lock the gate again until I leave for good.

I walked down the street to the shore, perhaps one long New York block's length, smelling a floral fragrance in the air, and into the restaurant's large open-air seating area. Music and lights implied it must be open, but I saw nobody. Then I noticed someone calling out and waving from a table across the road, at the edge of the water. I went there and found a couple, who were the proprietors of the restaurant. They spoke no English, French or Spanish, just Greek and some Italian. Between all this we managed to agree on what I would eat--which turned out to be two fried fish and a plate of squid-o's. They also brought me small pieces of toast covered with herbs and a little vinegar, something I had never had before.

Tomorrow I have to manage to get a taxi and a train to Athens.

These are some terms I avoid using, with explanations of why I reject them.

There is another similar list in<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html"> gnu.org</a> containing software-related terms that we should avoid using.

</p>

<ul> <li>

Age of Trump: Let's not magnify the troll/cheater/bully by designating this age as being entirely about him. </li><li>

Bicycle sharing system: This refers to local systems for bicycle rental. To call rental "sharing" is a misleading PR campaign. </li><li>

There is nothing inherently wrong with bicycle rental systems, but the ones that actually exist are unjust and inexcusable<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html"> because they track their users.</a>  </li><li>

Children: Humans up to age 12 or 13 are children. After that, they become adolescents or teenagers. Let's resist the practice of infantilizing teenagers by not calling them "children". </li><li>

Custody: refers primarily to the legal relationship parents have to their children. To apply the same word to the relationship between prison guards and prisoners is a euphemistis cover for cruelty. </li><li>

Detained: I am frequently detained on the street, in train stations, and in airports. The people that detain me typically ask, "Are you Richard Stallman?" Then they say they appreciate my work, though often they are misinformed about<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html"> what the Free Software Movement really stands for.</a>

Being thus detained is not a painful experience. When people<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"> call the GNU system "Linux" </a>and

By contrast, being taken away by thugs who might hold you prisoner for a short time or a long time is a pain in the neck, or worse. It can be stressful, harmful, and even dangerous.

To describe that occurrence by a passionless word such as "detained", which is used for events far less grave and perhaps even pleasant, is to deny the essence of what is happening. For those occurrences, I say "arrested" or "jailed", according to the specifics. </li><li>  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html" >think I advocate "open source",</a> that disappoints me, but there is a positive side: it gives me a chance to educate them about those differences, and ask them to<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/help/"> help GNU and free software.</a>

Dreamers: I support the DREAM Act, which would allow unauthorized childhood immigrants, those who have been in the US for many years, to remain and apply for citizenship. However, I do not call them "dreamers", because the term seems corny to me. </li><li>

First daughter: This silly and pointless term promotes treating the president's family as a royal family. The founders of the US decided to address the president as "Mr President" precisely to avoid this danger. </li><li>

First lady: This term elevates the president's family to a quasi-royal status. Why should being married to an official deserve special obeissance? Even if we admire the president and per spouse, there is no reason to give that spouse a title that puts per above other citizens. We don't do that for the president. </li><li>
First nations: I don't use the term "First Nations" to refer to indigenous peoples of the Americas.

The first problem with "First Nations" is that it presumes that the concept of "nation" was applicable to all peoples in the Americas ever since the humans first migrated there. The concept of "nation" is a bad fit for some places and times. The concept is European, and refers to a kind of self-conception that in the past was not found everywhere. (Not today either.)

Ancient Greeks thought of themselves as a nation (though they had never been politically united). Ancient Egypt seems to fit the concept of nationhood. But can we describe the Etruscans as a nation? Did they ever think of themselves in such a way?

Mesopotamia, Syria or Anatolia had empires that conquered various ethnic groups, some of the time. Does it make sense to call those ethnic groups "nations"?

In some places, where ethnic groups blend into neighboring ones and boundaries of states keep changing, it is hard to claim that any specific nations exist. In Europe in 1600, England was a nation; so were France, Spain, and Poland. But what nations existed in what we now call Germany and Italy? It is imponderable.

Turning to the Americas, the classic Maya's warring city-states resembled the earlier Greek warring city-states, and had a common mythology and writing, so maybe they were one nation. At the same period, Teotihuacan was the seat of an empire that dominated various ethnic groups; later the Aztecs did likewise. I'm not sure how to apply the concept of "nations" there.

Elsewhere there were hunter-gatherer bands that intermarried with other nearby bands. They could be classified into ethnic groups, but were those "nations"?

The word "first" is also problematical. If we stretch the word "nation" enough to fit all the peoples of 6,000 years ago in the Americas, it would fit equally well for the peoples of the other continents. None of those putative nations was "first".

I think the term "first immigrants" would fit better fit the indigenous peoples of the Americans, since their ancestors made up the first wave of immigration to the American continents.

However, what bothers me most about "First Nations" is visible in the capital letters habitually used for the expression. It is the slogan of a PR campaign to which I have not decided to give blanket support.

So I generally call those peoples "indigenous peoples" (of the Americas). </li><li>

Honor killing:< a href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#patriarchalmurder

"> Patriarchal murder. </a></li><li>

Inappropriate: The vaguest possible word for criticizing a action. It means "not suitable under the circumstances." That is a judgment call, not a clear rule that people would agree on.

Such vague criticism can never justify the conclusion that the person criticized has done wrong. Any act might be frowned upon by someone.

If you want to demand that someone be fired or prosecuted for some action, or punished or censured in any way, it behooves you to make an accusation that is concrete, not vague like "inappropriate". You need to say what the alleged wrong was, so we can judge how wrong it was. If you can't allege something more concrete grave than "inappropriateness", we must presume it wasn't bad enough to take action about — except discuss what is the right judgment.

Men now face being fired for vaguely sexual conversations that were not sexual harassment and that no one complained about -- using the term "inappropriate", because no concrete criticism applies.

See also this example.

Once there is a concrete criticism about a person's actions, we have a concrete issue to consider. </li><li>

Latinx: Please don't write that pseudo-word unless you are prepared to pronounce it as well. If you want a gender-neutral English word to refer to people from Hispanic America, how about "Latin"?

Using the convention I proposed for gender-neutraity in Spanish, the word would be "latinis", but my proposal has not been adopted much yet.

</li><li> 

Native Americans: Anyone who was born in America is a native American. That includes me.

As regards the indigenous peoples of the US, I call them "indigenous peoples", the same term I use for all the rest of the world.

</li><li> 

Obamacare: I don't use this term because it treats Obama's medical insurance law with a certain amount of derision. While that system doesn't do enough — the main flaw being that it is based on private insurance companies — it was a substantial advance. I don't want to promote derision towards it.

</li><li> 

Partner: This word means someone you are business with. To use it in regard to a love relationship is, in effect, to model your idea of love on the idea of business. I think it is misguided to model important areas of life in terms of mere business.

</li><li> 

People of color: The term "people of color" endorses a racist outlook towards humanity by treating "color" as as a matter of essence, of the substance a person is made of, rather than as the superficial detail it really is.

The distinctions we call "racial" are grab-bags of various details of appearance, which may correlate more or less with certain ancestral groups. They are real differences, but not inherently significant; they have no importance except to the extent that racism gives it to them. Let's avoid using essentialist language to refer to them.

Aside from that, it twists the English language. What next? Will we be asked to say "people of whiteness", "people of tallness", "people of shortness", "people of brownness of hair"?

</li><li> 

Pro-choice: A way to support the right to an abortion while failing to challenge condemnation of abortion.

I support abortion rights, not "choice".

</li><li> 

Pro-life: People who assert that fetuses are human beings, and that their lives are sacred but only until they are born, use the term "pro-life" to pass themselves off as supporters of human rights. Let's not promote their pretense.

Giving birth kills some women. The US now has the highest rate of maternal death among wealthy countries, partly due to abortion-resticting policies that force some women to give birth. So we could call this movement "pro-death".

</li><li> 

Rendition: I've often enjoyed renditions of music that I hear at concerts. Not all of them are good, however. Sometimes I have the impression of hearing notes that are out of tune.

Snooty music fans sometimes say that listening to a bad musical rendition is torture, but they exaggerate. The worst rendition is nothing like kidnaping people and handing them over to states that will torture them. Calling that "rendition" is propaganda designed to disconnect our feelings from the crimes it describes.

Let's refuse to use that word.

</li><li> 

Sexual assault: this term is so broad that using it is misleading. The term includes rape, groping, sexual harassment, and other acts.

These acts are not merely different in degree. They are different in kind. Rape is a grave crime. Being groped is unpleasant but not as grave as robbery. Sexual harassment is a not an action at all, but rather a pattern of actions that constitutes economic unfairness. How can it make sense to group these behaviors things together?

It never makes sense. News articles, studies, and laws should avoid that term.

</li><li> 

Sex trafficking: This term is gravely ambiguous. It usually means trafficking people for sex (enslavement of people as prostitutes), but I've seen it apparently used to mean trafficking in sex (all prostitution, including voluntary prostitution). Such an ambiguous term is an invitation to bad thinking.

</li><li> 

STEM: I think it is fun to learn math, science, and technology, and good to teach them—to students that want to learn them.

I think it is sad when someone feels compelled to study those fields.

In any case, I won't call them by the chic buzzword "STEM". We already have perfectly fine names for those fields.

</li><li>

Water protectors: I support the movement that tries to block construction of new pipelines for fossil fuels, but calling the protesters "water protectors" focuses attention on the local danger of the pipeline (spills might contaminate water supplies) rather than the global danger of global heating, that threatens the survival of civilization.

Let's call them "climate protectors".</li>

  <p>
    Those people call themselves "Libertarians", but that term is
    propaganda for their peculiar views.  It embodies a claim that
    respecting "human rights" includes letting businesses trample their
    workers, their customers, the environment, and the public; that it
    requires leaving poor people on their own if they can't afford
    food, water, or medical care.

<p>
  To resist this manipulation, I referred (and still refer) to those
  hijacked troops as "the Bush forces".  They were not "our troops"

  "x" with an additional, parallel stroke running from lower left to
  upper right, and it is pronounced like Spanish "j" or Greek chi.

</li>

<li id="ilducino">
  <b>Il Ducino:</b> Silvio Berlusconi, corrupt right-wing ruler of

  "<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2016-jul-oct.html#3_August_2016_(Patriarchal_murder)">patriarchal
  murder</a>" is a fitting replacement. Firstly, because these
  killings are usually murder &mdash; planned in advance. Secondly, because
  they come from a twisted patriarchal idea of "honor", which treats a
  woman as property.
</li>

<li id="phobia">
  <b>&hellip;phobia:</b> A phobia is one thing, and bigotry is another.
  When referring to bigotry against a class of people, I therefore
  avoid terms based on "phobia".
  <p>
    Most of the time, the word "bigotry" is enough anyway.

<li id="pissi">
  <b>PISSI:</b> the Pseudo-Islamic State of Syria and Iraq.  Calling
  it the "Islamic State" endorses their claim to represent Islam. That
  claim is dubious, since most Muslims say otherwise; endorsing it
  plays into its hands.  Since it stands for a twisted and distorted
  version of Islam, it is really a pseudo-Islamic state.

  refuses to support false accusations made against them by thugs.

<li id="horrible">
  <b>Presidente Horrible:</b> former president Álvaro Uribe of
  Colombia, who was associated with the country's worst
  gangsters/terrorists, the right-wing paramilitares.  In Spanish,
  "Horrible" sounds close enough to "Uribe" for "Álvaro Horrible" to
  be funny.
</li>

<li id="repression">
  <b>Repression forces:</b> When a country's forces of control carry
  out repression, we should not help them cover that up by calling
  them "security forces".
  So in those cases I call them "repression forces".  "Security"
  for the state against the people is not security for the country.

<li id="saboteur">
  <b>Saboteur:</b> The troll places in charge of each cabinet
  department a saboteur whose job is to make it do the opposite of its

  Treasury, the Saboteur of the Interior, the Saboteur of Health and
  Human Services, the Saboteur of Energy, and the Saboteur of
  Education.  The heads of individual agencies do not have the formal
  title of Saboteur, but they are informally addressed as Saboteur

  <p>
  Usually only a few thugs commit the physical violence, but
  when one thug makes a false accusation, the rest lie to support it.
  That's why they deserve the term "thugs" as a group.
  They are so habituated to perjury that they have their own word for it:

                <h1>How the Ramayana endorses caste bias</h1>

                <h2>2018-04-18</h2>

                <p>
                    How the Ramayana endorses caste bias &mdash; from the translation by Hari Prasad Shastri, a brahmin, page 1585. (Sent to me by Shiva Shankar.)
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Asked by Lord Rama why was he performing religious rituals, Shambuka, the one described as of lower caste said:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Oh Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performingthis rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head. The Shudra being slain, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni's followers, cried out, "Well done! Well done!" overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu. In their supreme satisfaction, the Gods said to that hero, Rama "Thou hast protected the interests of the Gods, O Highly Intelligent Prince, now ask a boon, O Beloved Offspring of Raghu, Destroyer of Thy Foes. By thy grace, this Shudra will not be able to attain heaven!"
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Raghava is another name for Rama.

                <h2>We can make English gender-neutral while respecting agreement of number.</h2>

                <p>
                    Writing or speaking English, we always face a conundrum when we need a pronoun to refer to a person without specifying gender. Previously we needed a way to cover both male and female; nowadays some people state that they don't want to be considered either of those.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is pressure to refer to a single person as "they", but that is confusing in practice as well as jarring. Therefore I have adopted a method of making English gender-neutral while still distinguishing between singular and plural.
                </p>

                <p>
                    English speakers have traditionally faced a choice between several bad options for referring to someone of unspecified gender:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Always say "he". This was the rule in the time when sexism was official policy, but using it today would endorse sexism.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always say "she". This rejects the traditional sexism by reversing it. The book Ancillary Justice did this, and was acclaimed, but this practice is just as inaccurate as always saying "he".
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always say "he or she". This is long and sounds bureaucratic. Also, it does not provide for nonbinary genders.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always say "he/she". This variant of the previous option is shorter in print but more bureaucratic in tone.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Alternate between "he" and "she". This method is not bureaucratic, but it takes some effort and care, as I've found in years of using it in my speeches. Also, it does not provide for nonbinary genders.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Always say "they". This violates the grammar of English so deeply that it feels terribly wrong. It also results frequently in confusing expressions in which the referent of "they" is unclear. For example:
                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/canada-gender-identity-training-lawsuit-clothing-public-alberta">"When
					my child was removed and placed with Dad, they
					internalised it and took it like they did
					something wrong."</a> (Both the child and Dad internalized it?)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.themarysue.com/bystanders-harassment-guide/">"Keep building the safe space. Keep eye contact with them and
					don’t acknowledge the attacker’s presence: the absence of response
					from you two will push them to leave the area shortly."</a> (Which of these people does "them" include?)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/she-phubbs-me-she-phubbs-me-not-smartphones-could-be-ruining-your-love-life-68463">"My
					partner places his or her smartphone where they

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/18/cambrils-attack-four-suspects-shot-dead-by-one-officer-police-say">"Spotting

						the officer raised their rifle and shot four of them dead."</a> (The officer raised the attackers' rifle?)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can figure out what these sentences are intended to mean, with a little thought. So can I. That doesn't alter the fact that the pronoun confusion puts a gratuitous obstacle in the path of comprehension.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Use an artificial new pronoun such as "ey" or "zhe". This solution works, and avoids the confusion of using "they", but people reject those pronouns because they do not fit naturally into English.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The proponents of "they" argue that it is the correct choice because people have long used it occasionally in the singular. While it is true that people did so, that shows only that they faced a similar choice between bad options. Some chose "they" as the least bad, but that doesn't make it a good solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We need not choose among the bad solutions. Thanks to Marge Piercy's book, Woman on the Edge of Time, we have a clean, clear and natural solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    * Use the elegant gender-neutral pronouns "person", "per" and "pers". They fit into English smoothly. They are easy to remember, since they come from "person", and the last two resemble "her" and "hers". They are natural to use, since they work just like "she", "her" and "hers". "Pers" ends in a voiced consonant, just like "hers".
                </p>

                <p>
                    This solution is superior, since it does the job while avoiding all the drawbacks of the other solutions. I now use these pronouns some of the time in writing and speech, as illustrated in the rest of this article.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In using them, I've found that I wished that "person" were quicker to say, so I have coined the shorter alternative "perse", made from "person" by omitting the last syllable. It sounds like "purse", and represents the pronout "person" but not the noun "person". "Perse" and "person" as pronouns are equivalent and interchangeable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Perse" and "purse" are not confused in speech because the singular noun "purse" requires a preceding determiner while a pronoun cannot have one. For example, "The purse is here" refers to an object, whereas "Perse is here" refers to a person.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are those who claim that we have an obligation to refer to someone using whatever pronouns person might choose. I disagree with that position, on grounds of principle and grounds of practice. I think we should respect other people's gender identification, but which pronouns we use for any particular gender identification is a separate matter &mdash; a matter of grammar. We do not owe it to anyone to change our grammar according to per wishes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Person" etc. are just as gender-neutral as "they" etc., but since they are singular they fit a singular antecedent. Gender neutrality need not imply a sacrifice in English grammatical clarity; it is still possible to have both.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If someone says, "Please use 'ella', 'la', 'le' and 'su' for me," I will follow that request in Spanish (treating per as female). However, I will refuse to use them in English, because those pronouns are not English. If perse says, "Our pronouns are 'we', 'us', 'our' and 'ours'," referring specifically and only to perself, I will not use them &mdash; I will not say, "We drank too much and crashed the car," if the meaning is that perse alone did so. Likewise if someone asks me to refer to per with the pronouns "he", "her" and "its", or with "hy", "hap", "happy" and "hyne".
                </p>

                <p>
                    I respect a person's choice of gender identification by using the pronouns and words that go with it. "Person" (or "perse"), "per", and "pers" are gender-neutral; they respect any gender identification, just as completely as singular "they" would do. I would not presume to dictate to other people what pronouns they should use in their speech, but we can all state our preferences and the reasons behind them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for "they", if you are plural by nature &mdash; for instance, if you are a colonial organism or a group mind, or if you wish to be known for having multiple personalities &mdash; I will use that plural pronoun to refer to you.

    Here's an idea for making anonymous payments to a web site for any
    reason.  It works by charnging for a phone call, which can be paid for
    using prepaid phone cards.
</p>

<p>
    You use the web site to figure out the amount of payment.  The site
    also gives a phone number to call, and a numeric code to identify the
    transaction.
</p>

<p>
    You phone that number from any phone, enter the code, and it charges
    the phone the proper amount.  Then it tells the site that the payment
    has been made.
</p>

<p>
    It is not much use to do this from your own phone, since that will
    identify you to the site.  But if you do it with a prepaid phone card,
    using someone else's phone or a public phone, the site will not have
    any idea who is calling.  It will, however, know it has been paid.
</p>

<p>
    On a public phone, you could even pay it with coins.

	Facebook is a surveillance engine, accumulating lots of personal data
	which is also available to the state.  For your privacy and freedom's
	sake, it is important not to have an active Facebook account; refusing
	blocks Facebook's main channel for collecting information about you
	and, through you, about your friends and relatives.  (Whatsapp, a
	subsidiary of Facebook, is also important to avoid.)  Explaining to
	them why you firmly insist on routing your communications with them
	through some other system will strengthen your will power to resist
	systems that use you to harm you and others.
    </p>

    <p>
	Nowadays Facebook has gained so much power that it puts freedom and
	democracy in danger.  Its rules for what can be published amount to
	censorship of society as a whole, leading to political disputes.  But
	those disputes are a distraction from the bigger point that no company
	should have so much power.
    </p>

    <p>
	Facebook has the power to manipulate elections through subtle policy
	changes.  Whether or not it has intentionally done so, this state of
	affairs is dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
	Many organizations maintain a Facebook page to attract public support.
	Having the page does not directly harm the organization.  However, if
	it's not careful, the page will add to Facebook's power.
    </p>

    <p>
	Organizations typically manage Facebook pages to aim for the maximum
	possible visibility.  Facebook's cunning engineers have designed the
	system so that the way to get maximum visibility is to boost
	Facebook's power as much as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
	The simple way to completely avoid this is to refuse to have a
	Facebook page.  However, a compromise may be possible, one which
	attracts public support while not boosting Facebook's power much.
	This article proposes such a compromise.
    </p>

    <h3>General principles</h3>
   
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Make the organization's own web site the go-to place
		for all information about the organization.  Whatever
		people want to know, the web site should be the best
		place to look for it.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Say in the Facebook page that the organization's own
		web site is the best place to look for information
		about the organization.  Explicitly ask people to make
		links always to the web site, never to the Facebook
		page.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Adopt this motto: "Facebook is a bad place for a
		person to be.  When people find us on Facebook, we
		lead them away from Facebook and then talk with them
		elsewhere."
	    </li>
	</ul>

    <h3>What to post on Facebook; what not to post</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Select what you post on the Facebook page so that the
		organization's own web site is clearly the best place
		to find information about the organization.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Do post important new articles and announcements from
		the organization on Facebook, but only around half of
		them.  Then say, in the Facebook page, "See our web
		site &mdash; we have a lot more there."
	    </li>
 <!-- I'm told that this animated gifs don't really work, and that videos are
      only visible in Flash.
	    <li>
		Do post animated gifs on Facebook that present your
		organization's views and ideas &mdash; but only half
		of the ones you put on your web site.
	    </li>
  -->
	    <li>
		When you announce an event in Facebook, don't put the
		full story there.  Do state the place, date, time, and
		a brief description, enough for people to attend if
		they wish &mdash; but give a link to the page in the
		organization's web site about the event, and reserve
		part of the interesting information about the event
		for there.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Post the same list of event summaries in the web site,
		so that people who want a summary don't think Facebook
		is the best place to look for it.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Don't update all the fields of transitory information
		in the Facebook page.  Instead, when you change your
		the organization's web site significantly, update the
		Facebook "status" with a few words to say so.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		On the organization's website, provide a way for
		people to ask for notifications of changes and new
		announcements, so that they don't depend on Facebook
		for this.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Don't post on Facebook any information about the
		participants in your events &mdash; especially not their
		names.  Respect their privacy!  The only exception is
		names of speakers or teachers, as part of the advance
		description of events.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		In particular, don't post photos on Facebook that show
		any people.  Remember that Facebook identifies people
		in photos from their faces, and even from the backs of
		their heads.  Don't show anyone's head, viewed from
		any angle, to Facebook.
	    </li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Avoid Facebook messages</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>
		State in the Facebook page that those who wish to talk
		with the organization should use other systems,
		<em>not</em> through Facebook messages.  State which
		systems you prefer, and give the account names or
		numbers to use.
	    </li>
	</ul>

    <p>
	Other communication systems may have other flaws.  At the FSF we use
	mainly email and phone calls; we use SIP for audio/video communication
	over the internet, but never Skype because Skype requires proprietary
	client software.  However, the crucial point here is that <em>any</em>
	communication method other than Facebook and WhatsApp (owned by
	Facebook) will move people out of Facebook.
    </p>

    <p>
	If someone sends you a Facebook message despite your request,
	respond by saying, "Please let's switch to system X, Y or Z to have
	this conversation.  We do not want to give Facebook any more
	information about our organization or its participants, including
	you."
    </p>

    <h3>Avoid helping or boosting Facebook</h3>
    
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Don't mention the Facebook page in your web site or
		other postings.  The Facebook page is for those that
		look for it on Facebook.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Don't display a "Like" button on your web site.
		Facebook uses "Like" buttons in non-Facebook pages to
		track all visitors to those pages.  The button tracks
		even visitors that don't have Facebook accounts.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		It is advisable on general principles to use a browser
		such as <a
		href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">IceCat</a>
		that blocks tracking systems in web pages, including
		the Facebook Like buttons and most advertisements.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Another reason not to have a "Like" button in your own
		web site is that they encourage visitors to be more
		involved in Facebook.
	    </li>
	</ul>
    
    <h3>How you can communicate safely with Facebook</h3>

    <p>
	Facebook uses many methods to get data about people.  Some of them are
	rather tricky.  If people in the organization have Facebook accounts
	and want to use those to manage the organization's page, the
	organization has no reason to object.  But the organization <em>must
	never</em> urge a person to submit to Facebook's surveillance in order
	to manage the organization's page.  That would be a gross wrong to the
	person in question.
    </p>

    <p>
	Here is a guide for how people can manage the page using pseudonymous
	Facebook accounts.  A few of them stretch Facebook's commands, but it
	is not wrong to do that &mdash; Facebook does not deserve obedience.
    </p>

    
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Make an account under an alias for maintaining the
		organization's page.  Give made-up plausible data
		which is <em>not</em> humorous and doesn't relate to
		you.  Then <em>never</em> use the account for anything
		except to handle the organization's page.  Facebook
		will never have a reason to doubt the data on the
		account.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		If several people manage the organization's page, give
		each one a separate alias account.  Don't give any of
		the same data in two accounts.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Make a couple more such accounts as backup.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		The only more-or-less safe way to connect to Facebook
		is through a browser.  <em>Never</em> connect using
		Facebook's mobile app, because that requires giving
		Facebook access to other information on the mobile
		device, including personal contact information, text
		messages, calender events, and other confidential
		information.  This can expose personal information &mdash;
		yours and others'.  It can even expose sensitive
		information, harming you or others you know.  This is
		no surprise, because the app is proprietary software
		(an injustice in itself; see <a
		href="https://fsf.org/tedx">here</a>), and proprietary
		software commonly snoops on users (see <a
		href="http://gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-surveillance.html">proprietary
		surveillance</a>).
	    </li>
	    <li>
		It is safest to connect to Facebook only from a
		computer that belongs to the organization and is in
		the organization's office.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        To make the site work without the need to run
		nonfree Javascript code, visit
		to <code>m.facebook.com</code>
		rather than <code>facebook.com</code> itself.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		If you ever connect to Facebook from your own computer
		(rather than the organization's computer in its
		office), do it this way: install the Tor Browser
		Bundle (available for Windows and OS X as well as
		GNU/Linux) and use it to visit <a
		href="https://m.facebookcorewwwi.onion/">https://m.facebookcorewwwi.onion/</a>
		rather than Facebook directly.  This stops Facebook
		from determining your location or your IP address.
		<br />
		Note: the site <code>facebookcorewwwi.onion.to</code> is a fake.
		Don't be fooled.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Never "check in" at a location no matter how much
		Facebook nags you.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Make a separate local account on the computer for each
		Facebook account, connect to it from that local
		account, and don't ever use that local account for
		anything else.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		If you don't make a special local user account to talk
		to Facebook from, delete cookies <em>immediately</em>
		after each connection with Facebook.  Not just once a
		day!  Facebook uses cookies to surveil other browsing
		done from the same account.  Many browsers will allow
		you to specify a setting to treat all cookies as
		one-session cookies.  That will delete them
		automatically, provided you shut down the browser
		after each connection with Facebook, which is
		advisable.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Do not give Facebook access to any real account on any
		other site.  If Facebook demands info about your other
		accounts, make real accounts that you don't really
		use, and tell Facebook about those.  It is OK to give
		Facebook the email addresses that the organization
		publishes for contact from the public, but not the
		passwords of those email accounts.
	    </li>
	</ul>
    

    <p>
	Facebook <a href="/facebook.html">harms people in many
	ways</a>, and there is no way to completely avoid the harm.
	We hope this compromise approach to Facebook will provide
	benefit to the organization, while saving it from becoming
	Facebook's tool.  Meanwhile, there are many other social
	networks one can use.  Many well-known centralized social
	networks are less intrusive than Facebook; what's more, <a
	href="https://www.gnu.org/software/social/"> GNU Social</a>
	and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a>
	respect users' rights through a decentralized architecture,
	based on <a target="_blank" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
	software</a> &mdash; why not try them?

The "celebrity threesome injuction" forbids publication in England and
Wales of the identities of a famous married couple who reportedly had
sex with someone else.  In other words, nothing bad, or important.
</p>

<p>
The couple's identities have been published in articles in the US, in
Scotland, and in Ireland, but the UK Supreme Court
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/celebrity-threesome-case-risks-undermining-law">
absurdly continues
the injunction anyway</a>.
</p>

<p>
The reported threesome is so un-scandalous that, on first reading
about it, I wasn't curious enough to wonder who they were.  However,
censorship is a more important issue.  Google search has reportedly
deleted those articles from searches, censoring the whole world in
obedience to the UK injunction.
</p>

<p>
When I read that about Google, I thought that duckduckgo.com must be
better.  If duckduckgo does not do business in the UK, it should be
able to ignore the injuction, just as it can ignore the censorship
orders of countries such as China and Turkey.  Then I decided to
investigate whether this was true.
</p>

<p>
When I searched there for "celebrity threesome injunction", only
articles without their names appeared in the first few pages of
results.  Eventually one metioned the name of a newspaper which
printed the information.  When I specified that in the search, there
were still no results that gave the names -- but one item led me to
the information.
</p>

<p>
Only when I searched for "celebrity threesome Elton" did the search
results include articles that identified people involved.  This proved
that the articles do exist, and that duckduckgo does index them.
So why didn't they appear in the first search.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know how to ask duckduckgo whether it is censoring
some search results in response to this injuction?
</p>

<h2>
Addendum (20 May 2016)
</h2>

<p>
Today I tried searches for <em>celebrity threesome injunction</em> and
<em>celebrity threesome injunction Elton</em> in quick succession.
The latter included an article which named names, that did not appear
at all in the former.
</p>

<h2>
Addendum (22 May 2016)
</h2>

<p>
It appears that duckduckgo inherits this censorship from Yahoo.  The
company might want to take some steps to detect specific examples of
search result censoship, such as when items that appear when searching
yahoo for A B C D do not appear at all in a search for A B C without
D, and fix them.

Le chant du 29 novembre 2015
 le jour qu'il faut se manifester à Paris
 pour la défense du climat.

Allons enfants de la Mère Terre,
Le jour crucial va arriver,
&Agrave; tout règlement réfractaires
Sont de puissants États achetés.  x2

Entendez-vous sur les chemins
Rouler les autos, les camions ?
Sans cesse ils carbonisent le monde,
Réchauffant nos enfants à leur fin.

En lutte, citoyens,
Qu'ils nous arrêtent ou non,
Marchons, marchons !
Que trop d'émissions
Ne brûlent pas nos sillons.
</pre>

<p>
Translation:
</p>

<pre>
Arise, children of Mother Earth,
The decisive day is about to arrive.
Rejecting any solution
Are powerful sell-out states.   x2

Do you hear, in the streets,
The sound of the cars and the trucks?
They fill the air with greenhouse gas,
Heating our children to their end.

To the struggle, citizens,
Whether they stop/arrest us or not,
Let's march!
So that an excess of emissions
does not burn our fields.
</pre>

<p>
I do not try to present the complexity of the issue in 13 lines,
but these statements are basically correct.
</p>

<p>
It may seem an exaggeration to put innocent-seeming cars and trucks in
place of the murderous enemy soldiers of the Marseillaise &mdash;
actually it is an understatement.  The cars and trucks (standing for
fossil fuel use in general) are far more deadly; global heating is
<a target="_blank" href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/climate-inaction-idINDEE88O0HH20120925">
on track to kill hundreds of millions of people</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2015-jul-oct.html#02_September_2015_%28Heat_wave_in_Europe%29">
Heat waves and droughts</a>, made more frequent by global heating, have
already caused massive crop failures, in effect burning our fields.
</p>

<p>
I hope that the spirit of the Marseillaise will inspire us to curb
global heating in time to avert total climate mayhem and preserve
civilization.

                <<p>
The Logo sea turtle is an underwater vehicle designed as a toy.
Like the Logo floor turtle, it can turn, and move forward or back.
Unlike the floor turtle, which could turn and move only in a plane,
the sea turtle can turn in three dimensions.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the floor turtle's pen, the sea turtle has a pair of fans
it can extend on opposite sides.  Each fan is made of two crisscrossed
series of parallel rods, and has the overall form of a parallelogram.
Swiveling the rods widen the fan into a square or narrow it into a
think line, which could be turned to extend either sideways or back
along the side of the vehicle.
</p>

<p>
The turtle also has a command to shake from side to side.
</p>

<p>
Instead of a wire or a radio, the sea turtle uses sound to receive its
commands.  It recognizes several sorts of whistles, each with a
specific meaning.
</p>

<p>
The Logo floor turtle was meant for human children.  It was designed
to see whether and how they could play with it and what they could
learn by doing so.  Of course, we already knew that human children
could in principle play with such a thing.
</p>

<p>
The Logo sea turtle is meant for whales, to see whether and how they
could play with it and what they could learn by doing so.  We know
that some whales have enough skills and intelligence that they ought
to be able to do this.
</p>

<p>
To show them how to use the turtle, it might suffice to put it in the
water near some whales and then give it commands.  The whales will
hear the commands and see the turtle move.  If a whale imitates
one of the sounds and sees the turtle move, it will catch on.
</p>

<p>
Resident orcas might use the turtle as a sort of monster to herd fish;
the fans could make it appear big so as to drive fish.  Dolphins might
use it as a sex toy, which suggests equipping it with appropriate
protuberances and pits.  Whales might also like to scratch against it,
which why it has the shake command.

                <p>
    Around the U.S., the agents that control the public have been observed
    to beat up, shoot, kill, and arrest members of the public, with a
    special focus on protesters, members of minority groups, and people
    making recordings of the actions of those agents. This is often
    followed by fabricated accusations against the victim, meant to create
    false justification for the attack itself.
</p>

<p>
    To control these abuses, parts of the U.S. have begun ordering these
    agents to wear body cameras. Body cameras help restrain agents'
    violence but create problems of their own. For instance, when should
    the cameras record?
</p>

<p>
    There are occasions when the cameras should be off, including
    confidential discussions that are important not to
    record. Sometimes agents are invited into homes; it would be
    intrusive for them to make video recordings of everything visible
    inside the home, because the recordings might be studied later for
    signs of anything that could be prosecuted.
</p>

<p>
    However, if agents can turn their cameras off, they might do so
    precisely when they are going to commit violence, as appears to
    have happened in February 2015.
</p>

<p>
    I propose a technical system to control when these cameras record,
    removing most of the agents' discretion.
</p>

<p>
    The idea is that the system records its camera's video (and its
    microphone's audio) all the time, but normally discards all
    recordings 10 minutes after they are made. Certain events (let's
    call them "significant events") cause those 10 minutes of
    recording to be saved, and the following 10 minutes as well.
</p>

<p>
    Each agent's system detects certain significant events
    automatically. An agent can also manually declare a significant
    event by pushing a button. Either way, when one agent's system
    detects a significant event, it sends a radio signal to report the
    event to the systems of all agents within a certain reception
    distance--perhaps 50 meters.
</p>


    Here are proposed criteria for detecting a significant event:

    <ol>
	<li>
	    Whenever the agent removes a gun from its holster.
	</li>
	<li>
	    Whenever the agent takes a weapon in hand to use it,
	    including guns, tasers, sticks, and others.
	</li>
	<li>
	    Whenever the agent pushes a button to declare an
	    event. Agents should be trained and required to do this when
	    they see a violent attack or an injury, and then to aim their
	    cameras at least briefly toward whatever they saw.
	</li>
	<li>
	    Whenever the system's microphone detects a gunshot.
	</li>
    </ol>


<p>
    The particulars of each significant event should be posted
    promptly on a website so citizens can verify that they are not
    being watched without grounds. An agent who pushes the
    significant-event button or draws a weapon without good reason
    should be punished enough to make such abuses rare, and those
    recordings should be deleted.
</p>

<p>
    Another pertinent question is when the recordings should be made
    available to agents, prosecutors, a court, or the public. I
    propose that recordings saved because of a significant event
    should be made available only when a judge rules that they cover
    part of an act of violence, or in response to a subpoena about a
    specific person who appears in a specific video. In particular,
    agents would have to wait for court approval to view the videos of
    events they participated in, and that would come after they make

The international banks, and their plutocratist politicians, have
rejected the easy course of giving Greece a path back to growth and to
repaying most of its debt.  They demand Greece accept six months more
of the "help" that would leave Greece even more desperate.  Apparently
they want to make an example of Greece to intimidate other victims.
</p>

<p>
With their rejection of Greece's last offer, their arrogance is now
explicit: they demand Greece choose between the disaster of economic
exclusion and the disaster of economic occupation.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that it is better to suffer by fighting and weakening
one's enemies than to suffer by surrendering and serving them.  It
seems to me that these banks oppress all of Europe, so rebelling
against them is imperative.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it seems to me that Greece should choose NO on July 5.  No to
the banksters' ultimatum, no to their dominion, and no to their
parasitism.
</p>

<p>
That's how it seems to me; but it is easy for me to say such things,
since I won't be the one who suffers.  It is for Greeks to say how it
seems to them.

The United States is plagued by large corporations with outsized
political power. They are “too big to fail.” So if they are about to
fail, they get rescued. Many are so big that they can block the laws
needed to stop them from
<a target="_blank" href="http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/entities/8-aig">
destroying the economy</a>
or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/01/mine-safety-massey-msha">the
  environment</a>.
</p>

<p>
We need to replace them with smaller companies, but U.S. antitrust law
is inadequate. It exists, but has been weakened over the past
decades. Consider the proposed “Volcker Rule,” which would make many
banks
<a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/25/news/economy/sandy-weill-banks/index.htm">
split into two companies</a>, one for risky investments and one for
loans based on savings, as the old Glass-Steagall law required.  This
would address some problems, but would not make banks small enough.
Eliminating “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/too-big-to-fail-watch/2012/05/16/gIQAHGI3TU_blog.html">too big to fail” banks</a> means making sure that each is
small enough that regulators, prosecutors and elected officials won’t
hesitate to let it suffer the consequences of its own decisions.
</p>

<p>
Using anti-trust law now to split up a company requires a lawsuit, and
many large companies can make that costly – as Microsoft did each time
it was convicted. Corporations can also use their political influence
to avoid being split,
<a target="_blank" href="http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/lu-18.pdf">
as Microsoft did</a> when last convicted.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that the larger companies get, the harder it is to enforce
antitrust laws against them. Yet, a business-friendly government can
vitiate the law simply by launching no antitrust cases – as the Bush
administration did.
</p>

<p>
When the government wins such a suit, the court splits up the company
to remedy the specific anti-competitive behavior proved. It can’t
split the company into 50 parts just to ensure they are all small
enough. We can’t fix the problem of too-big-to-fail companies this
way.
</p>

<p>
I propose another method ­– one that can be applied to all
companies. It works through taxes. There will be no need to sue
companies and split them up – because they will split themselves up.
</p>

<p>
The method is simple: a progressive tax on businesses. We tax a
company’s gross income, with a tax rate that increases as the company
gets bigger. Companies would be able to reduce their tax rates by
splitting themselves up.
</p>

<p>
With this incentive, over time many companies will likely get
smaller. They could subdivide in ways they consider most efficient –
rather than as decided by a court. We can adjust the strength of the
incentive by adjusting the tax rates. If too few companies split, we
can turn up the heat.
</p>

<p>
Big companies can afford clever lawyers. They may try, for example, to
pretend to split up into several companies that effectively work
together as one. So the new tax law must recognize this and treat such
entities as one company that pays the rate for its combined size. As
for how to recognize and define such combinations, we can probably
borrow solutions from antitrust law.
</p>

<p>
Corporations today are often multinational, and can
<a target="_blank" href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2013/01/congressional_research_service_finds_evidence_of_massive_tax_avoidance_by_us_corporations_using_tax.php">
play accounting
games between their divisions in various countries</a>. Yet we should not
let this thwart the plan: A multinational company’s tax rate for
income in the U.S. should be based on the size of its operations
worldwide.
</p>

<p>
Companies have
<a target="_blank" href="http://ctj.org/ctjinthenews/2012/04/the_nation_six_rigged_rules_corporations_use_to_dodge_taxes.php">
many accounting tactics for reducing their declared
profits</a> – so if the tax is levied on profits, they will likely
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">
game
the system</a>. It is far harder, however, for a company to disguise its
gross income. So let’s compute the tax based on gross income. This is
larger than the profit, so the tax rate we apply to gross income
should be smaller than what we would use to tax profits.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage in this is that an inefficient company pays the same
tax rate as an efficient company of the same size. A tax on profits
would tax the efficient company more, because its profit would be a
larger fraction of the same income.
</p>

<p>
You can also think of this as a variable-rate sales tax.
</p>

<p>
When corporations all pay the same sales tax rate, they pass the cost
along to customers. Thus, if the goal is to tax wealthy business
owners, a fixed sales tax doesn’t do the job.
</p>

<p>
However, businesses can’t pass the entire amount along to customers if
they pay different tax rates. If a large company pays 5 percent and a
competing small company pays 1 percent, they could both pass along 1
percent but no more. The owners of the large company would have to pay
the other 4 percent – which is exactly what might convince them that
splitting up is desirable.
</p>

<p>
This tax would operate gently but firmly on a long time scale. It
would surely not make every large company split up in the first
year. But it could well change a structure that promotes mergers into
one that promotes dividing.
</p>

<h3>
Note (2017)
</h3>

<p>
We could also adjust the tax rate based on the fraction of any given
market that the company controls.  Thus, if part of the company's
income is from nonalcoholic beverages, and the company controls 20% of
that market, its sales from beverages would be taxed at a higher rate
because of that high market share.  This adjustment could be in addition
to the rate determined by the company's total size.

I want to say a few words about Hrant Dick, a courageous defender of
freedom of speech who sought to reconcile the Turkish and Armenian
peoples.
</p>
<p>
Freedom of speech means that people are free to say things that you
despise, and things that I despise, even things that we both despise.
Freedom of speech includes the freedom to criticize, offend, insult or
mock any person, any idea, any belief, any practice or any
institution.  Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right.
</p>
<p>
Hrant Dick heard that France was considering a law that would make it
a crime in France to say that the Ottoman Empire did NOT commit
genocide against the Armenians.  He declared that if that law were
adopted, he would go to France and say just that, daring France to
prosecute him, to defend the principle of freedom of speech.  In
November 2014 I met with French officials, mainly about free software, but
I also urged them to repeal that censorship law.
</p>
<p>
Dick had previously been prosecuted in Turkey for saying that
the Ottoman Empire DID commit genocide against the Armenians.  Turkey
has a law which makes it a crime to say that.
</p>
<p>
Freedom of speech means that people are free to say that there was a
genocide of the Armenians, and free to say that there wasn't one.
By denying freedom of speech to the French, the government of France
insults Frenchness.  By denying freedom of speech to the Turkish, the
government of Turkey insults Turkishness.
                </p>
<p>
France and Turkey should sign a treaty to abolish these censorship
laws and restore human rights in both countries.

A nest-group or "brotherhood" of aliens from the planet Koch
discovered Earth around 30 years ago, and sought to colonize our
planet.  They saw just two obstacles: first, humans were
technologically advanced enough to repel a single Kochian brotherhood
in open warfare; second, Earth was too cold for Kochians -- about
6 degrees C too cold.  The aliens struggled to invent a way to
Koch-form our planet, but after some observations realized that was
unnecessary: we would do it for them.
</p>
<p>
We were already doing it for them.  The global heating we were already
starting to cause would, in a century or two, bring Earth's
temperature to match that of planet Koch.  The resulting agricultural
failures and food wars would result in the breakdown of the globalized
trade and manufacturing system, and human technology with them.  The
remaining humans, fighting among themselves with their residual
weapons, would be no match for the aliens.
</p>
<p>
However, they needed to take steps to prevent us from avoiding this
fate.  Some humans had already figured out where their practices were
heading; governments were starting to organize to stabilize Earth's
climate.  So the Kochians sneakily took over the major Earth oil
companies, then used them to set up plutocratic control over the
principal human governments, media, science museums, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Once plutocratic control was established, the Koch brothers used it to
direct humanity into burning increasing quantities of fossil fuels and
racing towards the conversion of Earth into a world more suitable for
Kochians than for humans.
</p>
<p>
Humanity hardly resisted; it was not united.  Indeed, many greedy
human individuals, set on gaining more riches for themselves no matter
what the harm to humanity, spontaneously joined the effort without
knowing who was ultimately behind it.  The oil companies' money convinced
many to stand idly by.
</p>
<p>
Foretastes of coming disaster are now appearing, and some humans are
starting to defy the Kochians and plutocrats.  But it is almost too
late to avoid the disaster.  Can humanity throw off the control of the
Kochians and save Earth?  <a target="_blank" href="http://350.org">It's up to us.</a>

                <p>
In response to Better Never to Have Been, by David Benatar, I present
a criticism of the matrix of values which is the basis for the book's
central argument; specifically, against the claim that the
nonexistence of a potential suffering being is positive good.
</p>

<p>
Benatar's proposed matrix of values looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
	Being:          Existent    Nonexistent

	Suffering	  Bad	       Good
	Pleasure          Good	      Not good
</pre>

<p>
The uncontroversial second line means that the existence of a being
that has pleasure is a good, and the nonexistent of that being is the
absence of a good but is not outright bad.
</p>

<p>
Benatar's central claim is that the first line, for suffering,
is not the negative of the second line.  Rather, he claims,
the nonexistence of a suffering being is a positive good.
From this assertion he derives the conclusion that it would
be better for any being never to have existed, unless that being
never experiences any suffering in its life.
</p>

<p>
I argue that that central claim is mistaken; that the nonexistence of
a suffering being is the absence of bad, not a positive good.  First,
we must address an ambiguity in the calculation.  What constitutes a
nonexistent person that we should count?
</p>


<h3>* Counting possible persons from this world only</h3>

<p>
Suppose we interpret "nonexistent possible persons" as including only
those who are possible in the world as it is.  Only a minute fraction
of those possible people exist.  If each one that doesn't exist is a
positive good, comparable in size to the good or bad experienced by an
existing person, it follows that the total good is measured, to a
close approximation, by the number of possible people -- which, with
this interpretation, can be changed by our own actions.  We could
contribute enormous good to the world by increasing the range of
nonexisters (nonexistent possible persons), assuming nearly all of them
would suffer if they existed.
</p>

<p>
If we could double the range of possible people without any other
change in the world, there would be (slightly more than) twice as many
nonexisters.  If each one contributes the same good, that
approximately doubles the total good.  The effects of whatever we
might do to alter the circumstances of _existing_ people would be
negligible by comparison.
</p>

<p>
How might we double the range?  One way is to create a new allele, not
found in nature, as an alternative to some existing gene found in all
humans.  Suppose this new allele would not be fatal but would cause a
lot of suffering.  Of course, to put that gene into anyone would be
cruel and wrong , but for this purpose we do not entertain the idea of
_using_ it.  The goal is achieved by its mere existence, which would
(more than) double the number of nonexistent possible humans, and thus
double the good of their nonexistence.  There could hardly be an
easier way to add so much good to the world, so we should focus our
efforts on this goal -- or so we would conclude from Benatar's matrix
of values.
</p>

<p>
This absurd conclusion shows it is a mistake to assign "good" to that
slot in the value matrix.  We must put there "absence of bad" -- in
effect, zero.  Whatever might have happened to a nonexistent potential
being contributes zero to the total good in the world and to the total
bad in the world.  Thus, the number of nonexisters has no effect on
any judgments about actual good or bad in this world.
</p>

<p>
Compared with pain felt by a being that exists, zero is a step up.  I
suggest that is sufficient to justify the conclusion that one ought
not to create a sentient being whose life would be great suffering.
</p>


<h3>* Counting possible persons from any world</h3>

<p>1
It is not clear that "nonexistent persons" must be limited to those
that could exist in the world as it is.  Another plausible
interpretation includes all persons that might exist even in worlds
different from our own.
</p>

<p>
With that interpretation, the set of possible persons is independent
of anything we do; our actions can only transfer some of the possible
persons from nonexistent to existent or vice versa.  It follows that
attributing a nonzero value X to the nonexistence of a possible person
is equivalent to counting the value -X for the existence of the same
possible person.  These two value matrixes are equivalent as regards
preferences between scenarios, because they differ uniformly for all
scenarios by the constant X.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we are entitled remove the paradox of a nonzero value X for
a nonexistent possible person by subtracting X from both sides.
</p>

<h3>* Conclusion about the good of a nonexistent sufferer</h3>

<p>
If we count only the persons that are possible in the actual world,
the paradoxical nonzero value for a nonexistent sufferer is wrong; if
we count all the persons possible in any world, the paradoxical
nonzero value can be removed by a reformulation that makes no real
difference.  Either way, we can use a value matrix that avoids the
paradox.
</p>

<h3>* Worth of starting or continuing life</h3>

<p>
Benatar also discusses the difference between the question of whether
a person's life was worth starting (for that person), and whether it
is worth continuing at time t (again, for that person).  They are
different, but how much?  I suggest that they may have quite different
answers for an adult, but there is little difference between them for
someone born recently.  In other words, I propose that this equation
holds, in the absence of some grave problem in X's birth,
</p>

<pre>
  lim   Is X's worth continuing    =   Was X's life worth starting
   t -> start of X's existence
</pre>

<p>
which says that the value of X's existence as a function of time is
continuous at the time of X's birth.

The US is plagued by the "revolving door" in which people move between
government agencies (and Congress) and companies that want to
influence legislation.  It is impossible to prohibit this directly
because of the legal principal that those people have the right to do
work.
</p>

<p>
It might be feasible, however, to fine companies based on the number
of ex-officials working for or with them in roles that are likely to
give the company unfair influence.
</p>

<p>
To have an effect, the fine would have to be a substantial fraction of
the company's relevant business income (not merely its profit) for
each such ex-official.  This would apply only to important officials
that could decide policy, not to former civil service employees.
</p>

<p>
I propose a large fine rather than simple exclusion of companies that
work with ex-officials, because (1) that might exclude all companies
in a given field, and (2) the fine puts pressure on every company to
<em>reduce</em> its use ex-officials, whatever its current level of
such use may be.
</p>

<p>
There will surely be some downside to this policy, but that has to be
compared with the (often hidden) cost of the corruption of the current
lobbying system, which has left the public in the US with

Geologists say that humans are changing the Earth's climate to a point
that constitutes a new geological epoch.  I think it is a bad idea to
call it the "Anthropocene" epoch.
</p>

<p>
That name could inspire irrational pride in some humans: they might
regard the new epoch as a kind of medal for humanity.  "Bully for us
-- we've changed Earth's geology!  No life forms have done that since
algae started making oxygen."  Even people who would not consciously
say this may be unconsciously view the coming catastrophe is a
triumph.  This could undermine the impetus to curb global heating.
</p>

<p>
I therefore suggest adopting some other name while it is still
possible.
</p>

<p>
The name that best fits what's likely to happen in this epoch is
"Obscene", but I think that is too jocular to be used for global
disaster.
</p>

<p>
Since the change in climate consists of global heating and its
consequences, the name could be "Thermocene".  The heating is caused
mainly by combustion of fossil fuel and forests, so another
possibility is "Pyrocene".

Doing these jobs costs money, so we need the state
to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/05/01/why-i-love-taxes-and-so-should-you">collect
taxes</a> to pay for these jobs.  The state should make the rich (and
big businesses) pay a much higher tax rate because they can afford it.
Taxes are bad only when the state spends much of them on war and
corruption.
</p>

<p>
We need a state to stop businesses from conspiring eliminate
competition, or becoming so big and powerful that the state doesn't
dare regulate or tax them as is necessary.
</p>

<p>
Above all, we need a state in order to have democracy, which is the
system by which the many non-rich join together to overcome the power
of the rich and thus deny them control over society.
</p>

<p>
It's not that I implicitly "trust" the state; rather, that question is
a side issue.  We can't do without it.  Keeping the state on the right
path requires paying constant attention, so that is what we must do.
            </p>

<p>
Businesses are terribly dangerous and corporations are psychopaths.
Businesses will work people into the ground, while cheating and
occasionally killing their customers, if we don't stop them.  Each
business's CEO will argue that it must regretfully do so because its
competitors do.  I am skeptical about the regrets, but even if they
are sincere, they are no substitute for ending the wrongs.
</p>

<p>
The only systemic way we can be powerful enough to overcome those
businesses' power is to join together through a democratic state.
</p>

<p>
The US government does many of these jobs badly, and some not at all.
This is mainly because businesses and the rich have too much control
over the government.  In practical terms, it is no longer a democracy:
it has fallen under the power of the plutocrats, so it no longer
serves to keep them in check.  The plutocrats also control the
mainstream media, and use them to spread lies
and <a target="_blank" href="http://fair.org/"> distract people from real issues</a>.
</p>

<p>
The plutocrats don't want us to reclaim control of our government and
make it do its many jobs.
Therefore, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/07/11/ending-ronald-reagan-lie">
their basic lie</a> is the claim that government can't help people and
people shouldn't try to use democracy for their aims.  If we believe
that, we won't see any solution for our main problem: curbing the
plutocrats &mdash; and we will give up.
</p>

<p>
Americans, don't give up on reestablishing and then using democracy!

I think the ideal society would be one in which we don't need a state
any more, because people have learned how to cooperate and treat each
other decently without one.  I don't see any way for this to happen
for life in general, but it is possible in specific activities.</p>

The company name "Exxon" is properly written with the letter exx,
which looks like an x with two parallel lines in one direction.  (Look
at the company's logo.)  The same sound appears in the German word
"ach".  Exx is derived from, and pronounced like, the Greek letter
chi, which looks like an x; but since that shape was already in use in
the Roman alphabet as the letter x, this letter had to be modified
by adding the parallel line.
</p>

<p>
When writing in the traditional Roman alphabet, since the letter exx
is not available, we use the digraph "xx" as a substitute.  The
pronunciation is the same.
</p>

<p>
"Exxon" is properly pronounced somewhat like the exclamation "yexx",
minus the initial "y", followed by "on".  If you encounter people who
pronounce it like "exon", please set them straight.  An exon is
something else &mdash; a part of a gene which is actually translated
into protein (as opposed to introns, which are spliced out before
translation).  Some chemicals in Exxon petroleum could cause mutations
in your exons, but aside from that the two words are unrelated,
and they don't sound the same.

Prominent universities are using a nonfree license for their digital
educational works.  That is bad already, but even worse, the license
they are using has a serious inherent problem.
</p>

<p>
When a work is made for doing a practical job, the users must have
control over the job, so they need to have control over the work.
This applies to software, and to educational works too.  For the users
to have this control, they need certain freedoms (see
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org</a>), and
 we
say the work is
"free" (or "libre", to emphasize we are not talking about price).  For
works that might be useful in commercial contexts, the requisite freedom
includes commercial use, redistribution and modification.
</p>

<p>
Creative Commons publishes six principal licenses.  Two are free/libre
licenses: the Sharealike license CC-BY-SA is a free/libre license with
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft">copyleft</a>, and the
Attribution
license
(CC-BY) is a free/libre license without copyleft.  The other four are
nonfree, either because they don't allow modification (ND, Noderivs)
or because they don't allow commercial use (NC, Nocommercial).
</p>

<p>
In my view, nonfree licenses that permit sharing are ok for works of
art/entertainment, or that present some party's viewpoint (such as
this article itself).  Those works aren't meant for doing a practical
job, so the argument about the users' control does not apply.  Thus, I
do not object if they are published with the CC-BY-NC-ND license,
which allows only noncommercial redistribution of exact copies.
</p>

<p>
Use of this license for a work does not mean that you can't possibly
publish that work commercially or with modifications.  The license
doesn't give permission for that, but you could ask the copyright
holder for permission, perhaps offering a quid pro quo, and you might
get it.  It isn't automatic, but it isn't impossible.
</p>

<p>
However, two of the nonfree CC licenses lead to the creation of works
that can't in practice be published commercially, because there is no
feasible way to ask for permission.  These are CC-BY-NC and
CC-BY-NC-SA, the two CC licenses that permit modification but not
commercial use.
</p>

<p>
The problem arises because, with the Internet, people can easily (and
lawfully) pile one noncommercial modification on another.  Over
decades this will result in works with contributions from hundreds or
even thousands of people.
</p>

<p>
What happens if you would like to use one of those works commercially?
How could you get permission?  You'd have to ask all the substantial
copyright holders.  Some of them might have contributed years before
and be impossible to find.  Some might have contributed decades
before, and might well be dead, but their copyrights won't have died
with them.  You'd have to find and ask their heirs, supposing it is
possible to identify those.  In general, it will be impossible to
clear copyright on the works that these licenses invite people to
make.
</p>

<p>
This is a form of the well-known "orphan works" problem, except
exponentially worse; when combining works that had many contributors,
the resulting work can be orphaned many times over before it is born.
</p>

<p>
To eliminate this problem would require a mechanism that involves asking
<em>someone</em> for permission (otherwise the NC condition turns into a
nullity), but doesn't require asking <em>all the contributors</em> for
permission.  It is easy to imagine such mechanisms; the hard part is
to convince the community that one such mechanisms is fair and reach a
consensus to accept it.
</p>

<p>
I hope that can be done, but the CC-BY-NC and CC-BY-NC-SA licenses, as
they are today, should be avoided.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, one of them is used quite a lot.  CC-BY-NC-SA, which
allows noncommercial publication of modified versions under the same
license, has become the fashion for online educational works.  MIT's
"Open Courseware" got it stared, and many other schools followed MIT
down the wrong path.  Whereas in software "open source" means
"probably free, but I don't dare talk about it so you'll have to check
for yourself," in many online education projects "open" means "nonfree
for sure".
</p>

<p>
Even if the problem with CC-BY-NC-SA and CC-BY-NC is fixed, they still
won't be the right way to release educational works meant for doing
practical jobs.  The users of these works, teachers and students, must
have control over the works, and that requires making them free.  I
urge Creative Commons to state that works meant for practical jobs,
including educational resources and reference works as well as
software, should be released under free/libre licenses only.
</p>

<p>
Educators, and all those who wish to contribute to on-line educational
works: please do not to let your work be made non-free.  Offer your
assistance and text to educational works that carry free/libre
licenses, preferably copyleft licenses so that all versions of the
work must respect teachers' and students' freedom.  Then invite
educational activities to use and redistribute these works on that
freedom-respecting basis, if they will.  Together we can make
education a domain of freedom.

I saw a doctor this week.  Before the appointment, I was asked to sign
a privacy policy consent form which started out this way
</p>
<ol>
<li>The Practice's privacy Notice has been provided to me prior to my
    signing this consent...
</li>
<li>
   The Practice reserves the right to change its privacy practices 
    that are described in its Privacy Notice, in accordance with
    applicable law.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since I was unwilling to sign a false statement, I asked to see the
privacy notice.  The receptionist offered me another copy of the
consent form.  I said I already had that, but that it referred to a
"privacy notice" and that's what I didn't have a copy of.  The
receptionist said, "The rest of this page gives a summary of the
privacy notice."  It was a very brief summary and treated few points.
I said, "This clearly refers to some other Privacy Notice, and it asks
me to sign a statement that I have seen it.  I cannot sign that if it
is not true."
</p>

<p>
She said it was a binder 3,000 pages long.  I said that I would not
ask for a copy, but I did want to take a look at it.  She went to look
for it, then came back and said she could not find it, but asked me to
sign anyway.
</p>

<p>
I said, "Are you asking me to lie?"  She said, "No, I am asking you to
sign a piece of paper."  I said. "I cannot sign a statement that is
not true."  She said, "You can reschedule your appointment for some
other time."  I suggested, "How about if I add 'not' to make it a true
statement?"  She accepted this.  So I had my appointment.
</p>

<p>
The substance of the issue probably doesn't matter much.  There is no
real confidentiality of medical records in the US, since the police
can get them under very easy conditions.  Nonetheless, it is a
dishonest proceeding, systematically asking patients to accept
policies they have not seen and then make false statements.

In the late 70s, a beggar outside Harvard Square station asked for a
quarter to take the subway.  I gave him one.  As I walked down the
stairs I noticed that he was not coming along.  Instead he was asking
another person for a quarter to take the subway.  I looked at him
for a minute to show him I knew he had lied to me.
</p><p>
When beggars say they want money to take the train home, or to get
some food, they may be telling the truth, or they may be lying.  I had
heard people say that pandhandlers lied, but now I knew for certain.
I did not want to be an easy mark for liars, so I decided never to
give money to a beggar.
</p><p>
However, I did not want to become someone who is of no help to people
who are telling the truth.  So I came up with a way to separate the
honest beggars from the liars.
</p><p>
When a beggar asks me for money, I never give money.  But if he refers
to food or eating, I offer to give him food instead.
</p><p>
About half the time, the beggar mumbles an excuse and declines the
offer.  I figure those are the ones who were lying.
</p><p>
About half the time, the beggar accepts this offer.  So we go to a
nearby store (I choose which).  I invite her to choose the food,
within limits (for instance, I won't buy bottled beverages, since
anyone can get water to drink).  I pay for it and give it to her.
This typically costs several dollars, but I don't mind; I am glad to
give it since I know it is a good cause.  Since this only occurs
occasionally, the expense is not significant.
</p><p>
If a beggar asks for money to take a bus or subway train, I do not
give him money.  Instead I offer to pay his fare directly.  I will
walk a few blocks and wait a few minutes to do this, unless I am in a
hurry.  If I had responded thus to the lying panhandler at Harvard
Square, he would not have succeeded in tricking me.  But if he had
been honest, I would have helped him.
</p><p>
This is what I do in the US, where I understand the situation enough
to judge what to do.  In a foreign country, where I am just passing
through, I don't give to beggars, because I don't understand the local
situation well enough to figure out what I should do.  If I were
living there, I would study the problem and come up with a response.

Andrew Holland was
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6918001/Man-cleared-of-porn-charge-after-tiger-sex-image-found-to-be-joke.html">
prosecuted in the UK</a> for possessing "extreme
pornography", a term which appears to mean porn that judges and
prosecutors consider shocking.  He had received a video showing a
tiger having sex with a woman, or at least apparently so.
</p>
<p>
He was found innocent because the video he received was a joke.  I am
glad he was not punished, but this law is nonetheless a threat to other
people.  If Mr Holland had had a serious video depicting a tiger
having sex with a woman, he still would not deserve to go to prison.
</p>
<p>
After reading about that case, I was curious about which kinds of pornography
the state is prepared to imprison people for.  Here's what the statue
says to define "extreme pornography":
</p>

<p>
    The elements of the offence (Section 63 subsections (2) to (8))
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
  There are three elements to the offence. An image must come within 
    the terms of all three elements before it will fall foul of the
    offence.
  </li>
  <li>
  Those elements are:
  <ol>
    <li>That the image is pornographic;</li>
    <li>That the image is grossly offensive, disgusting, or otherwise of an 
    obscene character, and</li>
    <li>That the image portrays in an explicit and realistic way, one of the 
    following extreme acts:
    <ol>
      <li>An act which threatens a personâ??s life;</li>
      <li>An act which results in or is likely to result in serious injury to 
    a person's anus, breast or genitals;</li>
    <li>An act involving sexual interference with a human corpse,</li>
    <li>A person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an 
    animal (whether dead or alive),
    and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that the people 
    and animals portrayed were real.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
  
<p>
This law is not only unjust, it's spectacularly irrational.
</p>
<p>
The concept of "sexual interference with a human corpse" is curious.
All a corpse can do on its own is decay, so the only possible
"interference" is to prevent its decay.  Thus, "sexual interference"
rationally would mean some sexual activity while injecting
embalming fluid, or while putting the corpse into a refrigerator.  However, I
doubt that the censors interpret this term rationally.  They will have
cooked up an excuse for some twisted interpretation that enables them
to punish more people.
</p>
<p>
This censorship cannot be justified by protecting corpses from
suffering.  Whatever you do to a corpse, it can't suffer, not even
emotionally.
</p>
<p>
Then there is the prohibition of realistically depicting sex with an
animal.  The law does not care whether the animal wanted sex.  I've
read that male dolphins try to have sex with humans, and female apes
solicit sex from humans.  What is wrong with giving them what they
want, if that's what turns you on, or even just to gratify them?
</p>
<p>
But this law is not concerned with protecting animals, since it does
not care whether the animal really had sex, or really existed at all.
It only panders to the prejudice of censors.
</p>
<p>
A parrot once had sex with me.  I did not recognize the act as sex
until it was explained to me afterward, but being stroked on the hand
by his soft belly feathers was so pleasurable that I yearn for another
chance.  I have a <a href="../parrot-love.jpg">photo of that act</a>;
should I go to prison for it?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I am spared because this photo isn't "disgusting", but
"disgusting" is a subjective matter; we must not imprison people
merely because someone feels disgusted.  I find the sight of wounds
disgusting; fortunately surgeons do not.  Maybe there is someone who
considers it disgusting for a parrot to have sex with a human.  Or for
a dolphin or tiger to have sex with a human.  So what?  Others feel
that all sex is disgusting.  There are prejudiced people that want to
ban all depiction of sex, and force all women to cover their faces.
This law and the laws they want are the same in spirit.
</p>
<p>
Threatening people with death or injury is a very bad thing, but
violence is no less bad for being nonsexual.  Is it worse to shoot
someone while stroking that person's genitals than to shoot someone
from a few feet away?  If I were going to be the victim, and I were
invited to choose one or the other, I would choose whichever one gave
me the best chance to escape.
</p>
<p>
Images of violence can be painful to see, but they are no better for
being nonsexual.  I saw images of gruesome bodily harm in the movie
Pulp Fiction.  I do not want to see anything like that again, sex or
no sex.  That is no reason to censor these works, and would still not
be a reason even if most people reacted to them as I do.
</p>
<p>
Since the law doesn't care whether a real human was really
threatened with harm, it is not really concerned about our safety from
violence, any more than it is concerned with avoiding suffering for
corpses or animals.  It is only prejudice, taking a form that can ruin
people's lives.

I recently read the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/The%20Zeitgeist%20Movement.pdf">
statement of principles of the Zeitgeist Movement</a>.
</p>
<p>
The first half, which criticizes the current economic system, seems to
be valid more or less (there are points I don't know enough to be
certain of).  However, the recommendations in the second half seem to
have basic flaws.
</p>
<p>
It proposes that we should entrust a computer system to decide how
much to make of every sort of product.  Given a well-formulated
problem, with a choice between a limited set of products, and a clear
idea of what they are useful for and who wants what, it might be
feasible for a program to calculate an optimal solution.  But real
life is far more complicated than that.  It might be feasible to
calculate how much resources to put into "growing chocolate", but how
could any centralized system decide how much to produce of the
thousands of different kinds of chocolate candies, chocolate pastries,
chocolate puddings.  Each person might like one of these more than
another because of subtle differences in taste and texture, which that
person would be hard put to describe.
</p>
<p>
The article also points out that societies can change values.  That is
true, but we don't know how to predict how they will change, let alone
how to change them to order.  Meanwhile, there are tremendous actual
differences in values.  Some value systems, such as the ones that
motivate "honor killings", deserve to be morally condemned and
rejected.  But there are many other variations in values within the
bounds of decency.
</p>
<p>
Also, I saw no solution for dealing with one aspect of human nature:
the tendency to compete for the admiration or envy of the
neighbors.  This drives competitive consumption, which is a major
cause of waste.  Wise people opt out of this, but if we want to lead
everyone to opt out, I don't think exhortations to wisdom will
suffice.  We would need a method that works.  I don't know of one,
but I don't see that the Zeitgeist Movement does either.

tax breaks.  They threaten to move the plant here or there,

<A target="_blank" HREF="http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/corp-focus/2003/000142.html">
    falls on the rest of us</A>.</p>

<p>
I think the states should bargain collectively with these companies.
That means they need to form a union.  We could call it the "United
    States of America."</p>

<p>Here's how it would work.  All the states would agree to be bound by a
rule that when a company considers locating a facility in more than
one place, none of those jurisdictions can offer it a tax break
without the consent of all the others.  Any jurisdiction that believes
a company is considering another location could make a complaint under
this requirement.  If the company then chose a different location, and
got a tax break there, it would be fined twice the amount of the tax
break.  The fine could go to the jurisdiction that made the
    complaint.</p>

<p>Of course, the states already have a so-called union,
and it could implement this policy simply by passing a federal law.
    It fails to do fulfill its mission because it has sold out to the companies.</p>

<p>The problem of <a href="/business-supremacy-treaties.html">
    business-supremacy treaties</a> relates to this, because their basic
wrong is to make countries compete with each other for which one will
    let businesses mistreat workers and the public the most.</p>
